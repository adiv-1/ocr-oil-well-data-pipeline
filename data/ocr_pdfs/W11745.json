Baker Field is located in the U.S. portion of\nthe Williston Basin, in McKenzie County, North Dakota. The original Basic Game & Fish\n34-3 was drilled directionally (due to surface restrictions on the Missouri River\nfloodplain) by Basic Earth Science Systems, Inc. in late 1985, reaching total depth in the\nMission Canyon Formation (Mississippian in age), below the Nessan zone. A string of\n5.5\" production casing was run to total depth after electric logging, and the Nesson zone\nwas perforated and completed.\nThe original Game & Fish 34-3 was completed for 98 BOPD, 0 BWPD and 64\nMCF gas per day. More recently, Nance Petroleum Corp acquired the well. Recent\nproduction from the Basic Game & Fish 34-3 was 23 BOPD and 6 BWPD. The well has\nProduced 224,525 BO, 107,142 MCFG and 6,623 BW through mid 2002.\nNance re-entered the Basic Game & Fish 34-3 and milled a window for\nsidetracking operations in November 2002. The horizontal leg is refrred to as 34-3H.\nThe four primary offset wells used for corretation while drilling the Basic Game &\nFish 34-3H are:\n1) the original open hole fogs from the Basic Earth Science Systems, Inc.\nBasic Game & Fish 34-3 (now owned by Nance Petroleum Corp.}, with\nthe surface location 392\u2019 FSL & 494\u2019 FWL in the SW SW Section 2,\nT153N, R101W, McKenzie Co., N.D.\n2) the John L.

Sidetrack #1\nproceeded in zone, in the upper Nesson porosity, until drilling out of the top of the target\naround 11,620\u2019 MD. The decision was made to pull back and sidetrack \u201cin zone\u201d, rather\nthe waste the time and footage to drill back down to the target. Part of the difficulty with\nrecovering from drilling out the top of the Nesson is the poor \u201cdrill-ability\u201d of the overlying\nbasal Midale argillaceous marker. \u201cSliding\u201d (or directionally orienting the well path)\nbecomes very slow and unproductive. Steering is much more effective within the\nNesson porosity itself. The Sidetrack #1 was terminated at 11,680\u2019 MD, at a position of\n970.22\u2019 North & 3,406.95\u2019 West of the surface location. This calculates to a point\napproximately 1,362' FSL & 2,371\u2019 FWL in the NE SW of Section 3.\n\nSidetrack #2 was initiated around 11,400\u2019 MD off of Sidetrack #1. Sidetrack #2\nproceeded \u201cin zone\u201d in the Nesson porosity, but initially at a deeper stratigraphic horizon\nthan Sidetrack #1. The early portion of Sidetrack #2 explored the lower 10\u2019 of the 15\u00b0\ngross Nesson porosity. A trip for a new bit was made at 12,040\u2019 MD in Sidetrack #2.\nDrilling of Sidetrack #2 proceeded after the bit trip mostly in the upper Nesson porosity\nuntil several factors necessitated the termination of the drilling. These factors included\nthe approaching legal \u201chardline setback\u201d, dead MWD batteries and the penetration of\nthe top the Nesson into the overlying basal Midale argillaceous marker. Sidetrack #2\nreached total depth at 12,800' MD. The Bottom Hole Location {BHL] at total depth in\nSidetrack #2 was 1,582.72\u2019 North & 4,338.8' West of the surface location, at\napproximately 1,975\u00b0 FSL & 1,439\u2019 FWL in the NE SW of Section 3.\n\n; Re-entry and horizontal drilling of the Basic Game & Fish #34-3H took 21 days\nand ~206 rotating hours. A total of 3,986.35 barrels of water were lost during drilling.\nThe Nesson laterals were left uncased for an acid stimulation and horizontal completion.\nGEOLOGIC EVALUATION\n\nThe geologic evaluation of the Basic Game & Fish #34-3H began at the window\nmilling operation, stratigraphically above the top of the Ratcliffe member of the Charles\nFormation (Mississippian in age), at 9,038' MD. Sunburst Consulting provided well site\ngeologists and a digital data gathering system. The digital gas information was\naugmented by the use of a digital gas chromatograph. Drilling rig data (including ROP\n[Rate of Penetration], on-off bottom status, and mud pump strokes) was received\nthrough a digital connection to the rig EDR {Electronic Oata Recorder]. The Sunburst\ngas detection readings were returned for display and monitoring to the rig EDR.\nEngineering and geologic data were then compiled and distributed on a digital drafting\nand Internet communications system.\n\nBUILD CURVE & LATERAL\n\nAfter milling the window in the pre-existing 5.5\" casing the directional portion of\nthe Basic Game & Fish #34-3H began. The KOP for the lateral was at 9,038' MD, just\n\n; above the top of the Ratcliffe zone of the lower Charles Formation (below the Base Last\nSalt).\n\nUNBURS} i, 4\nCONSULTING\nSn ERmeEaeeeememne nee ee CFO OCY Trav t\u00e9l"

    "text": "The Ratcliffe was encountered at 9,078\u2019 MD, 8,970' TVD, (-7107'). There was a\nsignificant hydrocarbon show identified within the Ratcliffe interval between 9,114\u2019 and\n9,124\u2019 MD. Gas peaked at 243 units [1% methane in air = 100 units] with large \u201cheavy\ngas\u201d components (C3\u2019s & C4s). Elevated backgound gas levels and large connection\nand downtime gas spikes were recorded for the balance of the drilling of the Basic\nGame & Fish #34-3H that are attributed (at least in part) to this zone. Samples\nrecovered from this Ratcliffe show interval included Limestone: light to occasional\nmedium brown, tan, very fine crystalline, occasional petoidal, occasional spotty black oil\nstain, dull green fluorescence, slow streaming cut _in_part, poor to very poor\nintercrystalline and interparticle porosity, occasionally anhydritic. These shows were\nconsidered exceptional for the Ratcliffe interval in this area, and warrant further\ninvestigation.\n\nThe Midale interval (also a member of the Charles Formation) was topped at\n9,189\u2019 MD, 9,056' TVD, (-7193'). There were only trace sample shows observed within\nthe Midale, with no significant gas increases over the high Ratcliffe background.\n\nThe top of the Mission Canyon Formation (Nesson zone) was reached at 9,350\u2019\nMD, 9,127.9' TVD (-7264.9') in the curve building portion of the lateral. Samples from\nthe initial contact with the Nesson porosity contained Limestone: tan, cream, very fine\ncrystalline, fragmental, occasionally peloidal, spotty black oil stain in vugs, yellow\n\n\u00e9 fluorescence in part, slow streaming cut in part, very poor interparticle and small pin\n\n\u2018 point vuggy porosity, occasional white to clear anhydrite & calcite crystals. Surface oil\n(free oil on the samples) was observed, probably coming from produced oil in the drilling\nfluid (mud). A trip gas spike of 1,802 units was recorded when the steerable assembly\nwas tripped into the hole at 9,475\u2019 MD. Due to an unexpectedly aggressive angle build\nin the last portion of the curve build, the top of the Nesson was once again encountered\nat 9,521\u2019 MD, 9,127\u2019 TVD as the well path moved back up stratigraphically.\nSIDETRACK #1\n\nSidetrack #1 was initiated to avoid the sharp upward climb of the end of Lateral\n#1. Sidetrack #1 remained predominately within the top 5\u2019 of the Nesson porosity, and\noscillating between the top of the Nesson and the relative \u201chard streak\u201d delineating the\nbase of the uppermost 3.5\u2019 to 5\u2019 (stratigraphically) of the Nesson porosity. The well path\ndid traverse up into the base of the Midale on two occasions, but it was possible to steer\nback down into the targeted Nesson porosity. A tabulation of the encounters with the\ntop of the Nesson / base of the Midale and with the \u201chard streak\" 3.5-5\u2019 down from the\ntop of the Nesson is presented in the table \u201cDip Estimates\u201d. Some of the recorded\nevents are based on Gamma Ray markers, while others (generally the \u201chard streak\u201d)\nare interpreted from drill rate and natural inflections of the well path. Samples from the\nupper Nesson porosity were generally limestone: tan, cream, very fine crystalline,\nfragmental, occasional peloidal, spotty black ail stain in vugs, yellow fluorescence, slow\n\n: to fast streaming cut in part, very poor interparticle and pin point vuggy porosity, with\n: some white to clear anhydrite and calcite crystals.\nUNBURS} i, 5\nCONSULTING\net antral enenruuiiiitt tr immseiminstinnre Prunus fA CEO OGY SERVI CH"

Gas background levels and the size\nof the connection gas and downtime gas spikes was greater fallowing the events at\n41,315\u2019 MD to 11,355 MD and 11,370\u2019 MD. Sidetrack #1 was terminated when the\nbase of the Midale argitlaceous zone was penetrated at a steep up angle.\nSIDETRACK #2\n\nSidetrack #2 was started off of Sidetrack #1 to avoid the encounter with the\n\u201ctough drilling\u201d basal Midale. Sidetrack #2 took off from Sidetrack #1 below the 3.5\u2019 to 5\u00b0\n\u201chard streak\u201d and the first portion of Sidetrack #2 was drilled in the lower 10\u00b0 to 12\u00b0\nstratigraphically of the Nesson porosity. Gas readings were generally higher up to\n11,700\u2019 MD than the balance of the drilling of Sidetrack #2. This would seem to indicate\nthat the shows were better in the lower portion of the Nesson porosity as we reached\nout beyond 3,500\u2019 Vertical Section [VS] from the surface location. After tripping for a\nfresh bit at 12,040\u2019 MD, the well path was returned to the uppermost 3.5\u2019 to 5\u2019 of the\nNesson. Free oil was noted coming over the shale shaker screens following the bit trip\n(associated with the trip gas). Samples recovered from Sidetrack #2 were generally\nsimilar to those described above for Sidetrack #1, but becoming progressively smailer in\n\n\u2018 size (milied up by the drill pipe while passing through the lateral portion of the hole) and\nincreasingly coated with free oil from the mud system. Some samples were little more\nthan an oily paste. In Sidetrack #2, one short excursion into the overlying basal Midale\nwas experienced and another close encounter (without drilling ail the way out of the\nNesson) was likely. Gas readings did depress somewhat with these \u201cout of porosity\u201d\nencounters. Interpreted and Gamma Ray - documented top and bottom of zone events\nare induded in this report in a table that addresses \u201cDip Estimates\u2019.\nSidetrack #2 was terminated when the legal \u201chardline setback\u201d was approached, the\nMWD batteries failed, and the basal Midale argillaceous marker was penetrated, all at\napproximately the same time.\nUNBURSTS:\nCONSULTING\nSan CE OLOGY Sen Tl"

The lateral exposed\na net 3,800' following the initial penetrations of ihe top of the Nesson. The vast majority\nlateral is interpreted to have been drilled within the Nesson, in or stratigraphically near\nthe Nesson \u201cporosity\u201d. The Basic Game & Fish #34-3H required 21 drilling days or\napproximately 206 drilling hours. The drilling operation generally went smoothly, with\nfew delays or problems. General sample quality (e.g. How representative were the\nsamples recovered 7) was rated as fair to poor due to very fine cuttings size out in the\nlateral. The show quality in the lateral was fair to good, with obvious oil staining and\nvisible open porosity.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n4} A window was milled in the original 5.5\" casing for directional sidetracking.\n\n2) A significant show was encountered in the Ratcliffe, which persistently\nproduced gas during the driiling of the well.\n\n3) The Nance Basic Game & Fish #34-3H was successfully steered to a\nhorizontal trajectory in the targeted Nesson zone of the Mission Canyon\nFormation. Two open hole sidetracks were performed to keep the well\npath in the target zone.\n\n4) There were 3,800' measured depth feet drilled in the lateral following the\ninitial penetration of the Nesson. Of the total footage drilled after initial\npenetration of the Nesson target 3,249\u2019 (or 85.5%) were drilled in or very\nnear the targeted porosity streak, 68\u2019 (or1.8%) were drilled just below the\ntarget streak, and 483\u2019 (or 12.7%) were drilled just above the ideal target.\n\n5) Sample show and visual porosity estimates indicated fair to good\nhydrocarbon production potential for the lateral. Fluid losses and free oil\nin the mud and on the samples also indicate permeability and movable oil\nphase.\n\n6) The Nance Basic Game & Fish #34-3H awaits open hole completion in the\nNesson lateral following an acid stimulation with the drilling rig after TD.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\ni Sunburst Consulting\nISUNBURS} i,\nCONSULTING\nst eens SS CF olotY SERVICE"

The workover project was completed on September 16, 1997 and\nmeets the requirements set forth in North Dakota Century Code Section\n57-51.1-03.\n\nThe workover project was performed from September 9, 1997 to\nSeptember 16, 1997. The total cost of the project was $29,075. The\naverage daily production prior to commencement of the workover project from\nDecember 1996 through May 1997 was 23.5 barrels of oil per day. The\naverage daily production during the first sixty days after completion of the\nworkover project was 38.7 barrels of oil per day.\n\nTherefore, it is determined the above listed well qualifies as a\nworkover project for tax exemption purposes. The Commission shall have ~\ncontinuing jurisdiction, and shall have the authority to review the matter.\nThe determination may be amended or rescinded by the Commission for good\ncause.\n\nSincerely,\nKent Lp\nPetroleum Engineer\nKF/dh\nec; Tax Dept.\n600 EAST BOULEVARD.

The entire second flow was restricted,\n\nmaking the fluid recovery and reported gas flow rate low. With the\n\ninformation available, it is impossible to pinpoint the true flow\n\nrate, permeability, or gas-oil ratio. It is quite possible that this\n\ntest could have flowed to surface. The skin factor and damage ratio\n\nnumbers are high due to tool restriction and do not suggest any\n\nsignificant well-bore damage was present at the time of this test. :\n\nIf you should have any questions concerning this test, please do not\n\nhesitate to call, We appreciate your work and look forward to serving\n\nyou again.\n.
