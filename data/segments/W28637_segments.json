Nabors B22 drilling the Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC - Chalmers 5300 21-19 10T \nduring January-February, 2015 in the Baker Field, McKenzie County, North Dakota. \n(G. Wayne Peterson, Sunburst Consulting) \n \nINTRODUCTION  \n \nThe Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC Chalmers 5300 21-19 10T [Lot 2 Section 19, \nT153N, R100W] is located approximately 7 miles south of the city of Williston in McKenzie \nCounty, North Dakota. The Chalmers 5300 21-19 10T is a horizontal Three Forks well within \nthe Williston Basin consisting of one 9,444' uncased lateral drilled toward the east. The vertical \nhole was planned to be drilled to approximately 10,341\u2019. The curve would be built at 12 degrees \nper 100\u2019 to land within the Three Forks. This well is a two section lateral which originates in the \nnorthwest quarter of section 19, then drilled east to the southeast quarter of section 20. \nDirectional drilling technologies and geosteering techniques were used to land in the Three Forks \nreservoir and maintain exposure to the ideal target rock.\n\nOFFSET WELLS  \n \nOffset well data used for depth correlation during curve operations are found in the \u2018Control \nData\u2019 section appended to this report. Offset well control was essential in curve operations, to \nsuccessfully land within the Three Forks. Formation thicknesses expressed by gamma ray \nsignatures in these wells were compared to gamma data collected during drilling operations in \norder to successfully land the curve. The target landing true vertical depth (TVD) was \nperiodically updated during drilling to ensure accurate landing of the curve.  \n \nGEOLOGY \n \nThe Charles Formation [Mississippian Madison Group] was logged 8,537' MD 8,536' TVD        \n(-6,460' SS). Samples in the lower portion of the Charles Formation consisted of a limestone \nmudstone, which was light brown, light gray brown, off white in color. It was microcrystalline, \nfirm-friable, laminated, with an earthy texture. A trace of intercrystalline porosity, as was rare \nspotty light brown oil stain Occasionally noted was a  dolomite mudstone, which was light \nbrown, light gray brown in color. It was microcrystalline, friable-firm, laminated, with an earthy \ntexture. Also noted was a trace of intercrystalline porosity, and occasional spotty light brown oil \nstain. Rarely noted was anhydrite, which was off white and cream in color. It was soft, \nmicrocrystalline, and massive with an earthy to amorphous texture. Following connections or \nperiods of non-circulation, gas peaks of 32 to 77 units were noted, as were drilling gas shows of \n24 to 103 units.   \n \nThe Mission Canyon Formation [Mississippian Madison Group] was logged 9,436' MD 9,435' \nTVD (-7,359' SS). The Mission Canyon Formation consisted of a lime mudstone that was \ndescribed as light gray, light brown, gray brown, trace dark gray in color. The lime mudstone \nwas predominately friable to firm, with an earthy to rarely crystalline in texture. Some intervals \ncontained a trace of black-brown algal material, a trace of fossil fragments, and traces of \ndisseminated pyrite. Also present was an \nargillaceous lime mudstone that was described \nas light gray, occasional medium gray, rare gray \ntan, rare off white, trace dark gray in color. The \nargillaceous lime mudstone was predominately \nfirm to friable, crystalline to chalky texture. \nSome intervals contained a trace of disseminated \npyrite.  Following connections or periods of \nnon-circulation, gas peaks of 63 to 160 units \nwere noted, as were drilling gas shows of 89 to \n294 units.  Rare intercrystalline porosity was \nnoted as well as traces to occasional spotty light \nbrown oil stain was occasionally observed while \nlogging the Mission Canyon Formation. \nFigure 2. Limestone with spotty light to medium \nbrown \nstaining \nfrom \nthe \nMission \nCanyon \nFormation.\n\nThe Upper Bakken Shale [Mississippian Bakken Formation] was drilled at 10,777' MD 10,727' \nTVD (-8,651' SS). Entry into this member was characterized by high gamma, elevated \nbackground gas and increased rates of penetration. The black to black gray carbonaceous and \npetroliferous shale was hard with a splintery to smooth texture. Fracture porosity was noted, and \ntrace minerals were observed to include disseminated pyrite and calcite fracture fill. \nHydrocarbons evaluated in this interval reached a maximum of 1,472 units.  \n \nThe Middle Bakken [Mississippian-Devonian Bakken Formation] was drilled at 10,803' MD \n10,743' TVD (-8,667' SS). Samples in the Middle Bakken Member were predominantly silty \nsandstone which was described as light gray brown, light brown, trace light gray in color. It was \nvery fine grained, friable, subround, smooth, moderately sorted, with calcite cement, moderately \ncemented. A trace of disseminated and nodular pyrite was noted as was fair intergranular \nporosity. Also noted was occasional light brown spotty oil stain. Hydrocarbons evaluated in this \ninterval reached a maximum of 614 units drilling gas, with a survey gas of 750 units, and \nconnection gas of 721 units. \n \nThe Lower Bakken Shale [Devonian Bakken \nFormation] was drilled at 10,880' MD \n10,785' TVD (-8,709' SS). Entry into this \ninterval was characterized by high gamma, \nelevated background gas and increased rates \nof penetration. The carbonaceous black, \nblack gray shale is petroliferous, hard, \nsplintery, smooth and exhibits possible \nfracture porosity. Trace minerals included \ndisseminated pyrite. Drilling gas in this \ninterval reached a maximum of 1,074 units. \n \n \nFigure 3. Black carbonaceous and petroliferous shale \nfrom the Lower Member of the Bakken Formation and \ngray siltstone from the underlying Pronghorn Member. \n \nThe Pronghorn Member [Devonian-Bakken Formation] was reached at 10,906' MD 10,796' TVD \n(-8,720' SS). Entry into this interval was characterized by lower gamma, and slightly slower \npenetration rates. Samples from the Pronghorn were siltstone which was dark gray trace gray \nblack, friable to firm, subblocky to subsplit. This siltstone was moderately dolomite cemented \nand included disseminated and nodular pyrite. Also noted was a trace of spotty light brown oil \nstain. Drilling gas in this interval reached a maximum of 552 units with a connection gas of 529 \nunits. \n \nThe Three Forks [Devonian] was reached at 10,956' MD 10,814' TVD (-8,738' SS) which was -\n1\u2019 low to the Oasis Petroleum NA, LLC Chalmers 5300 21-19 8T. The target zone of the Three \nForks was to be drilled in a predominately dolomitic 11 foot zone beginning 16 feet into the \nThree Forks. \n \nSamples in the Three Forks were predominantly dolomite which was described as light brown, \nlight gray, tan-cream, peach, trace pink in color. It was firm, laminated, with a microsucrosic\n\ntexture. Rare disseminated pyrite was noted as was occasional intercrystalline porosity. Also \nnoted was common spotty to rare even light brown oil stain. Also observed was light green-light \ngray green, rare light gray shale that was firm, subblocky, with an earthy texture. Occasional \ndisseminated pyrite was noted as was possible intergranular porosity.  \n \n  \n \n \nFigures 4, 5 & 6.  A predominately dolomitic sample low in the preferred drilling zone of the Three Forks       \n( left); a predominately dolomitic sample high in the preferred drilling zone of the Three Forks (middle); and \nsample of the underlying claystone (right). \n \nGas Show  \n \nGas monitoring and fluid gains provided evidence of a hydrocarbon saturated reservoir during \nthe drilling of the Chalmers 5300 21-19 10T. Oil and gas shows at the shakers and in samples \nwere continuously monitored. In the closed mud system, hydrostatic conditions were maintained \nnear balance, this allowed for gas and fluid gains from the well to be evaluated. Gas on the \nChalmers 5300 21-19 10T varied according to stratigraphic position and penetration rates which \nmay have reflected increased porosity. During the vertical, connection gas peaks of 35 to 160 \nunits were noted, as were drilling gas shows of 40 to 294 units, against a 10.25-11.45 lb/gal \ndiesel-invert mud weight. Background concentrations in the lateral ranged from 400 to 1,600 \nunits, against a 9.75-9.8 lb/gal saltwater gel drilling fluid. Connection peaks of 1,200 to 2,284 \nunits were observed, coinciding with the best shows. Drilling out of casing at 11,140 MD\u2019 \nyielded a trip/downtime gas of 2,227 units. Trips at 14,466\u2019 MD,  a short trip to 8,375\u2019 MD for a \nwashed pipe at 15,042\u2019 MD, and  a trip at 17,024\u2019 MD yielded trip gas of 2,278 units, and 1,968 \nunits, and 1,077 units respectively. Chromatography of gas revealed typical concentrations of \nmethane, characteristic of Three Forks gas.\n\nFigure 7.

Profile displaying total gas, gamma ray and rate of penetration.\n\nGeosteering \n \nRyan Energy Technologies provided personnel and equipment for measurement-while-drilling \n(MWD) services. The RPM directional drillers, Ryan MWD\u2019s, and Sunburst Consulting \npersonnel worked closely together throughout the project to evaluate data and make steering \ndecisions to maximize the amount of borehole in the targeted zones and increase rate of \npenetration (ROP) of the formation.  \n \nThe 805\u2019 curve first drilled 44\u2019 in 1 hour before a MWD failure caused it to be tripped out of the \nhole and the MWD replaced. The remainder of the curve was drilled in 25 hours with a bottom \nhole assembly (BHA) consisting of bit #5/re-run #4, a Smith MDI516 PDC bit, attached to a 2.38 \ndegree fixed NOV 7/8 5.0 motor. The curve was successfully landed at 11,140\u2019 MD and 10,834\u2019 \nTVD, approximately 20\u2019 into the Three Forks Formation. Seven inch diameter 32# HCP-110 \ncasing was set to 11,118\u2019 MD.  \n \nGeologic structure maps of the Chalmers 5300 21-19 10T and surrounding control wells had \nestimated formation dip to be approximately 0.5\u00ba down to the TD of the lateral. The preferred \ndrilling interval of the Chalmers 5300 21-19 10T consisted of a eleven foot zone located \napproximately sixteen feet into the Three Forks Formation. Penetration rates, gas shows, gamma \nray data, and sample observations were utilized to keep the wellbore in the preferred \nstratigraphic position in the target zone. Using offset well data provided by Oasis representatives, \nprojected porosity zones were identified in the preferred drilling areas.  \n \n \n \nFigure 9.  Offset well target definition, Indian Hills Prospect (Oasis).   \n \nSteering decisions were made by using target points and letter markers provided by Oasis \npersonnel. The low gamma (F) in the middle to lower portion of the target zone was often \nutilized to establish the well-bore\u2019s position in the target zone. If the well-bore moved toward the \nbottom of the target zone, the moderate gamma was observed. As the well-bore moved lower in \nformation, the higher gamma of the underlying claystone (G) was observed, as was the presence \nof claystone in collected samples. Slides were then utilized to move the well-bore back up into \nthe target zone. In accordance with the drilling plan the well-bore was steered down into the \nunderlying claystone at prescribed intervals in order to definitively establish the well-bore\u2019s\n\nposition in formation. As the well-bore moved higher, approaching the top of the target zone the \nhigh to medium fluctuating gamma between markers (D & E) was noted. Samples in the lower \ngamma portion of the target zone contained noticeably greater concentrations of the light brown, \ntan-cream, peach, trace pink dolomite; as the well-bore moved higher in zone the samples tended \nto have more of the light gray, off white, gray brown dolomite.  The TD of 20,562\u2019 MD was \nachieved at 08:25 hours CT February 18, 2015. The well site team worked together to maintain \nthe well bore in the desired target interval for 94% of the lateral, opening 9,444\u2019 of potentially \nproductive reservoir rock. The hole was then circulated and reamed for completion. \n \nSUMMARY  \n \nThe Chalmers 5300 21-19 10T is a successful well in Oasis Petroleum\u2019s horizontal Three Forks \ndevelopment program in Baker Field. The project was drilled from surface casing to TD in 18 \ndays. The TD of 20,562\u2019 MD was achieved at 08:25 hours CT February 19, 2015. The well site \nteam worked together to maintain the well bore in the desired target interval for 94% of the \nlateral, opening 9,444\u2019 of potentially productive reservoir rock. \n \nSamples in the Three Forks were predominantly dolomite which was described as light brown, \nlight gray, tan-cream, peach, trace pink in color. It was firm, laminated, with a microsucrosic \ntexture. Rare disseminated pyrite was noted as was occasional intercrystalline porosity. Also \nnoted was common spotty to rare even light brown oil stain. Also observed was light green-light \ngray green, rare light gray shale that was firm, subblocky, with an earthy texture. Occasional \ndisseminated pyrite was noted as was possible intergranular porosity.  \n \nGas on the Chalmers 5300 21-19 10T varied according to stratigraphic position and penetration \nrates which may have reflected increased porosity. The overall gas and hydrocarbon shows were \nencouraging and indicate a hydrocarbon rich system in the Three Forks.  \n \nThe Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC. Chalmers 5300 21-19 10T awaits completion \noperations to determine its ultimate production potential.  \n \nRespectfully submitted,  \n \nG.

The \napproval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than \nthe 500' setback from the north & south boundaries and 200' setback from the east & west boundaries within the \n1280 acre spacing unit consisting of Sections 19 & 20 T153N R100W.  \n \nPERMIT STIPULATIONS: Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for \nfilter sock disposal must be maintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, and must \nremain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations are \nconducted.  Due to the proximity of Lake Sakakawea to the well site, a dike is required surrounding the \nentire location.  OASIS PETRO NO AMER must contact NDIC Field Inspector Richard Dunn at 701-\n770-3554 prior to location construction. \n \nDrilling pit \nNDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that \u201ca pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well \ndrilling and completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will \nprevent pollution of the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits \nare prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized representative of the director prior to lining and use.  \nDrill cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings \npit.\u201d \n \nForm 1 Changes & Hard Lines  \n  Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.  \nThe proposed directional plan is at a legal location.  Based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum \nlegal coordinate from the well head is: 9972\u2019 east. \n \nLocation Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period) \n   Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the \napproved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report.   If circumstances require operations to \ncommence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may \nbe waived by the Director.  Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information \nnecessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other \ninformation that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the \ndrilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit.\n\nBrandi Terry \nJune 16, 2014 \nPage 2 \n \nPermit Fee & Notification \n   Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card .The permit fee has been received.  It is requested \nthat notification be given immediately upon the spudding of the well.  This information should be relayed to the \nOil & Gas Division, Bismarck, via telephone.  The following information must be included:  Well name, legal \nlocation, permit number, drilling contractor, company representative, date and time of spudding.  Office hours are \n8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is (701) 328-8020, leave a \nmessage if after hours or on the weekend.  \n \nSurvey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells \n   NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey contractor \nshall file a certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion.  Surveys \nmust be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director may \nrequire the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the \noperation of the director's office in a timely manner.  Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe \ndocument, with a certification cover page to certsurvey@nd.gov.    \nSurvey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.  \nSpecifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve \n(or when sliding) and 90 feet in the lateral. \n \nSurface casing cement \n \nTail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12 \nhours, and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi \nbefore drilling the plug or initiating tests.   \n \nLogs \n \nNDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of (1) a suite of open hole logs from which formation tops and \nporosity zones can be determined, (2) a Gamma Ray Log run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore, and \n(3) a log from which the presence and quality of cement can be determined (Standard CBL or Ultrasonic cement evaluation \nlog) in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set, this log must be run prior to completing the well.  \nAll logs run must be submitted free of charge, as one digital TIFF (tagged image file format) copy and one digital LAS (log \nASCII) formatted copy. Digital logs may be submitted on a standard CD, DVD, or attached to an email sent to \ndigitallogs@nd.gov \n   \nThank you for your cooperation.  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nSincerely,

\nRE:  Filter Socks and Other Filter Media \n \n \n \n \nLeakproof Container Required \n \n \n \n \nOil and Gas Wells \n \nDear Operator, \n \nNorth Dakota Administrative Code Section 43-02-03-19.2 states in part that all waste material associated with \nexploration or production of oil and  gas must be properly disposed of in an authorized facility in accord with all \napplicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations. \n \nFiltration systems are commonly used during oil and gas operations in North Dakota.  The Commission is very \nconcerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry. \n \nEffective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the \nwell is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations \nare conducted.  The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an \nauthorized facility.  Such containers must be: \n\uf0b7 \nleakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container \n\uf0b7 \ncovered to prevent precipitation from entering the container \n\uf0b7 \nplacard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container \n \nIf the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but \nonly upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request. \n \nAs previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01 \nstates in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production \nwastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste \nManagement.  Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the \nsolid waste program.  Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud, \ninvert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.  \n \nThank you for your cooperation.  \n \n \n \nSincerely, \n \n \n \nBruce E.
