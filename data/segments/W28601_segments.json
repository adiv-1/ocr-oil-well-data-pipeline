The Chalmers Wade \nFederal 5301 44-24 12TXR was planned to drill an approximately 9,985\u2019 lateral along a \nproposed azimuth of 94.3\u00b0. The well bore will be enhanced for production by multistage fracture \nstimulation. \n \nOFFSET CONTROL INFORMATION \n \nThe offset information can be found in the structure section of this report. The three offset wells \nused are located on the same pad, and were the Oasis Chalmers 5301 44-24 3BR [SE SE Sec. 24, \nT153N, R101W], the Oasis Chalmers 5301 44-24 2TR [SE SE Sec. 24, T153N, R101W], the \nOasis Chalmers 5301 44-24 4T2R [SE SE Sec. 24, T153N, R101W].\n\nFigure 2:  Offsetting control wells in relation to the Chalmers Wade Fed 5301 44-24 12TXR well. \n \nGEOLOGIC EVALUATION \n \nMethods: \n \nGeologic supervision of the Chalmers Wade Federal 5301 44-24 12TXR was provided by \nSunburst Consulting, Inc. with two well site geologists. A digital gas detector and chromatograph \nwere interfaced with a Pason electronic data recorder system. The unit of measure for gas on this \nwell was units (u), which was defined as 100 units equaling 1% methane equivalent in air. The \nEDR provided drill rate, on-off bottom and pump strokes to the gas detection computer and \nreceived total gas information from Sunburst for viewing around location. Lagged samples were \ncaught by the rig crew in 30\u2019 intervals from 8,200\u2019 MD to 10,720\u2019MD, 10\u2019 intervals from \n10,720\u2019 MD to 11,500\u2019 MD, and 30\u2019 intervals from 11,500\u2019 MD to 21,050\u2019 TD. Wet and dry \ncuttings were examined under a tri-ocular microscope and complete lithologic descriptions and \nsampling intervals are provided in the lithology document within this evaluation. The set of dry \ncuttings collected during the duration of the well were sent to the State of North Dakota. \nEvidence of light hydrocarbons present in the drilling fluid was reported by the gas \nchromatography equipment and documented on the mud log presented with this report. \n \nZones of Interest: \n \nThe Mission Canyon Formation (Mississippian; Madison Group) was drilled at 9,288\u2019 TVD       \n(-7,320\u2019) and is comprised largely of light gray lime mudstone followed by gray to tan earthy \ntextured argillaceous lime mudstone. Shows within the Mission Canyon ranged from 40 to 187 \nunits against 10.0 ppg mud.  \nMap By Clay Hargett \nOasis Petroleum North America\n\nFigure 3 & 4:  Wet cutting of the Lodgepole Formation (left) and False Bakken sub-interval (right) at 10X.  \n \nThe top of the Lodgepole Formation was logged at 9,843\u2019 TVD (-7,875\u2019).  In general the \nLodgepole can be described as a medium to dark gray brown argillaceous lime mudstone with a \ncrystalline texture and trace amounts of disseminated pyrite (Figure 3). The False Bakken \n(Carrington Shale), drilled at 10,572\u2019 TVD (-8,604\u2019), is comprised of very dark brown to black, \nslightly pyritic shale with an earthy texture, and was found to be soft to firm (Figure 4). Strong \nhydrocarbon shows in the lower 100\u2019 of the Lodgepole were as high as 140 total gas units; \nsuggest that some of the oil and gas from the Upper Bakken Shale may be exploiting fractures \nthought to exist in the Lower Lodgepole.   \n \nThe Bakken Formation (Devonian \u2013 Mississippian) has four formal members, an upper and \nlower black, fissile, organic-rich pyritic shale, separated by an arenaceous limestone, siltstone \nand silty sandstone middle member. These three members overlay a silty shale or siltstone of the \nPronghorn Member toward the basin depositional center. The Upper Bakken Shale was drilled at \n10,584\u2019 TVD (-8,616\u2019) with sample returns typically described as black, carbonaceous, \npetroliferous shale with trace amounts of disseminated pyrite (Figure 5). The Middle Bakken, \npenetrated at 10,599\u2019 TVD (-8,631\u2019), consists of a varying thickness and sequence of interbedded \nsiltstone, limestone and silty sandstone. Trace spotty light brown oil staining was present along \nwith gas shows as high as 899 TGU. This light brown spotty oil staining was common. \nPenetrated at 10,649\u2019 TVD (-8,681\u2019), the Lower Bakken Shale was described as a black to dark \nbrown carbonaceous shale with trace amounts of disseminated pyrite (Figure 6). Gas shows \nencountered in the Lower Bakken read as high as 1465u (C1-C4). The Pronghorn was penetrated \nat 10,649 TVD (-8,681\u2019) and is commonly described as a dark to medium gray siltstone with \ncalcite cement.\n\nFigure 5 & 6: Wet cuttings of the Upper Bakken Shale (left), Lower Bakken Shale (right) at 10X.  \n \nThe Three Forks Formation (Devonian; Kaskaskia Sequence) represents a regressive sequence \ndeposited in a supratidal sabkha environment. The top of the Three Forks was drilled at 10,669\u2019 \nTVD (-8,701\u2019) and is comprised of a light to medium gray, cream to off white sucrosic dolomite \nwith trace to occasional amounts of disseminated pyrite and light green shale also with trace \namounts of disseminated pyrite (Figure 8). Shows within the Three Forks Formation ranged from \n50 to 2805 units in a drilling mud of 9.6-9.9 ppg. \n \n \n \nFigure 7 & 8: Wet cuttings of the Three Forks dolomite and shale (left) and Three Forks dolomite and shale \n(right) at 10X.  \n \nGeo-steering: \n \nKick-off point for the curve was established from the isopach of the \u201cbase last salt\u201d marker \nto the Three Forks \u201ctarget\u201d in the offset wells. The Chalmers 5301 44-24 4T2R was used as \nthe primary offset through the vertical and curve sections. While drilling the curve, measured \ngamma ray signatures were compared to those of the three offsets and aided in the landing of \nthe curve. The landing target was confirmed by the depth of the False Bakken, which was \nconsistent with the offset wells. While drilling the curve, the mud motor broke in half leaving \nthe bit and lower part of the motor in the hole. As a result, the curve was plugged and a \nsidetrack was drilled. This initial sidetrack failed and resulted in the drilling of a successful \nsecond sidetrack. The second sidetrack curve was successfully landed within the Three Forks \nFormation at a depth of 11,451\u2019 MD (10,684\u2019 TVD) placing the well bore approximately 15\u2019\n\nbelow the top of the Three Forks Formation.  Directional tools were then pulled out of the \nhole and a string of 7\u201d casing was set (11,418\u2019 MD) and then cemented by Schlumberger.  \n \nSamples from the target zone varied in porosity, oil staining, color, cementation, and pyrite \ncontent. Stratigraphic location in the target zone was based on these sample observations \nalong with gas shows, drill rates and gamma ray values. Severe doglegs were to be avoided \nso as to obtain the desired vertical section and aid in a successful completion liner run at TD.  \n \nThe Oasis prospect geologist defined the  an initial target zone as an 12\u2019 zone that began 9\u2019 \nbelow the top of the Three Forks Formation and at the claystone member,  21\u2019 below the \nThree Forks Formation. The target zone consisted of an upper dolomite and shale interval \nreading 100-140 count gamma (A marker).  The center of the target interval was comprised \nof a warmer dolomite with greater amounts of shale reading 120-140 count gamma (B \nmarker). The base of the target zone was characterized by a clean dolomite with trace \namounts of shale with gamma readings of 40-100 (C marker). The A-C gamma markers were \nused for determining depth within the target interval and plotted on the Chalmers Wade \nFederal 5301 44-24 12TXR dip profile (Figure 10). \n \nGamma\n10630\n10648\n10667\n10685\n10703\n10722\n10740\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\n110\n120\n130\n140\n150\n160\n170\n180\n190\n200\n210\n220\n230\n240\n250\n260\n270\n280\n290\n300\nGamma\nDIP PROFILE\nN\nS\nDepth (TVD)\n  Gamma\nGammma\nOasis Petroleum North America, LLC\nLower Bakken Shale\nTop of Zone\nBase of \nZone/Claystone\nChalmers 5301 44-24 12TXR\nPronghorn\nThree Forks\n \n \nFigure 9:  Offset gamma ray profile of the upper Three Forks (0-100 api. scale) *See dip profile \n(Figure 10) for marker presentation* \n \nUsing the aforementioned information gathered during drilling, offset log information and \nthe structural data provided from Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC., well site geologists \nA \nB \nC\n\nwere able to anticipate, and interpret the local apparent dip during the drilling of the \nChalmers Wade Federal 5301 44-24 12TXR well. A total depth of 21,050\u2019 MD was reached \non August 22, 2014 at 13:48 CDT. The target resultant was 100% within the Three Forks \nFormation. The resulting structure of the Three Forks was a fall in TVD of 69\u2019 over 10,150\u2019 \nMD; resulting in an overall down dip of 0.39\u00b0 as portrayed on the Chalmers Wade Federal \n5301 44-24 12TXR dip profile (Figure 10). \n \n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n140\n160\n180\n200\n220\n240\n260\n280\n300\n320\n340\n360\n380\n400\n10630\n10640\n10650\n10660\n10670\n10680\n10690\n10700\n10710\n10720\n10730\n10740\n10750\n10760\n10770\n10780\n10790\n10800\n10750\n11250\n11750\n12250\n12750\n13250\n13750\n14250\n14750\n15250\n15750\n16250\n16750\n17250\n17750\n18250\n18750\n19250\n19750\n20250\n20750\nLower Bakken Shale\nPronghorn\nThree Forks\nTop of Zone\nCenter of Zone\nBase of Zone (Claystone)\nSide Track 2\nGamma\nDIP PROFILE\nE\nW\nDepth (TVD)\nGamma\nMeasured Depth\nOasis Petroleum North America, LLC\nChalmers Wade Federal 5301 44-24 12TXR\nSE SE Sec. 24, T153N, R101W\nMcKenzie County, ND\nEst dip = -0.77\u00b0\nEst dip = -0.81\u00b0\nEst dip = -0.95\u00b0\nEst dip = -0.54\u00b0\nEst dip = -0.95\u00b0\nEst dip = -0.68\u00b0\nEst dip = 0.00\u00b0\nEst dip = 0.17\u00b0\nEst dip = 0.13\u00b0\nNew Gamma \nTool @ 19,933' \nEst dip = 0.00\u00b0\nGross apparent dip = -0.39\u00b0\n \n \nFigure 10: Well profile representing estimated dip value & gamma ray for the Chalmers Wade Federal 5301 \n44-24 12TXR lateral. \n \nHydrocarbons: \n \nGas monitoring and fluid gains were monitored to evaluate the viability of this reservoir \nduring the drilling of the Chalmers Wade Federal 5301 44-24 12TXR well. In the invert mud \nsystem, hydrostatic conditions were maintained near balance. This allowed for gas and fluid \ngains from the well to be monitored. Gas shows were encountered in vertical, curve and \nlateral drilling of the well.  \n \nBackground gas observed during the drilling of the lateral ranged from 60 to 1200 units. \nInvert drilling fluid was used throughout the drilling of the vertical and curve weighing 10.0-\n10.8 ppg. The lateral was drilled with saline drilling fluid with a mud weight of 9.6-9.7 ppg. \nGas shows ranged up to 2250 units and connection gases were observed up to 3700 units. \nC1-C4 gas components were observed throughout the course of the lateral. Trip gases were \nobserved as high as 3,671 units. Oil shows were very light throughout the lateral ranging\n\nfrom 0-3% in sample. When present it displayed a light brown spotty oil stain that yielded a \nslow to moderate streaming to diffuse light green cut fluorescence. \n \nSUMMARY \n \nThe Nabors B25 drilling rig successfully drilled a 9,599\u2019 two-section horizontal well bore \nwithin the Three Forks Formation at the Chalmers Wade Federal 5301 44-24 12TXR. A mud \nprogram consisting of diesel invert (10.0\u201310.8 ppg), during the vertical, first sidetrack curve,  \nand second sidetrack curve build sections, and saline based mud (9.6-9.70 ppg), during the \nlateral maintained stable hole conditions and permitted adequate analysis of gas \nconcentrations.  \n \nProjections of dip were successfully used to maintain the well bore in the Three Forks \nFormation target for 81% of the lateral. Samples from the target consisted of a light to \nmedium gray, cream to off white dolomite with trace to occasional amounts of disseminated \npyrite and light green shale also with trace amounts of disseminated pyrite. Intercrystalline \nporosity was generally seen throughout the entire lateral. Hydrocarbon shows in the target \nzone were high throughout the lateral. Samples from the ideal zone contained a spotty light \nbrown oil stain.  \n \nThe Chalmers Wade Federal 5301 44-24 12TXR will be fitted with a 4 \u00bd\u201d production liner \nand swell packers in preparation for a fracture stimulation that will determine the true \ncommercial value of the well. The well currently awaits fracture stimulation. \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \nDaniel Haynes \n Sunburst Consulting, Inc. \nAugust 22, 2014"

The \napproval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be located \napproximately down the east-west axis of the spacing unit (within 250\u2019 of the section line per Commission policy) \nand no closer than the 200' setback from the east & west boundaries within the 2560 acre spacing unit consisting \nof Sections 19, 20, 29, & 30 T153N R100W.  \n \nPERMIT STIPULATIONS: Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for \nfilter sock disposal must be maintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, and must \nremain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations are \nconducted.  In cases where a spacing unit is accessed from an off-site drill pad, an affidavit must be \nprovided affirming that the surface owner of the multi-well pad agrees to accept burial on their property \nof the cuttings generated from drilling the well(s) into an offsite spacing/drilling unit.  DUE TO \nSTREAM ADJACENT TO THE WELL SITE, A DIKE IS REQUIRED SURROUNDING THE \nENTIRE LOCATION.  OASIS PETRO NO AMER must contact NDIC Field Inspector Richard Dunn \nat 701-770-3554 prior to setting conductor. \n \nDrilling pit \nNDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that \u201ca pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well \ndrilling and completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will \nprevent pollution of the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits \nare prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized representative of the director prior to lining and use.  \nDrill cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings \npit.\u201d \n \nForm 1 Changes & Hard Lines  \n  Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.  \nThe proposed directional plan is at a legal location.  The minimum legal coordinates from the well head at casing \npoint are: 594\u2019 south and 445\u2019 east.   Also, based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum legal \ncoordinate from the well head is: 10558\u2019 east.\n\nHeather McCowan \nJune 11, 2014 \nPage 2 \n \nLocation Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period) \n   Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the \napproved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report.   If circumstances require operations to \ncommence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may \nbe waived by the Director.  Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information \nnecessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other \ninformation that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the \ndrilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit. \n \nPermit Fee & Notification \n   Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card .The permit fee has been received.  It is requested \nthat notification be given immediately upon the spudding of the well.  This information should be relayed to the \nOil & Gas Division, Bismarck, via telephone.  The following information must be included:  Well name, legal \nlocation, permit number, drilling contractor, company representative, date and time of spudding.  Office hours are \n8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is (701) 328-8020, leave a \nmessage if after hours or on the weekend.  \n \nSurvey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells \n   NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey contractor \nshall file a certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion.  Surveys \nmust be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director may \nrequire the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the \noperation of the director's office in a timely manner.  Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe \ndocument, with a certification cover page to certsurvey@nd.gov.    \nSurvey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.  \nSpecifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve \n(or when sliding) and 90 feet in the lateral. \n \nSurface casing cement \n \nTail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12 \nhours, and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi \nbefore drilling the plug or initiating tests.   \n \nLogs \n \nNDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of (1) a suite of open hole logs from which formation tops and \nporosity zones can be determined, (2) a Gamma Ray Log run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore, and \n(3) a log from which the presence and quality of cement can be determined (Standard CBL or Ultrasonic cement evaluation \nlog) in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set, this log must be run prior to completing the well.  \nAll logs run must be submitted free of charge, as one digital TIFF (tagged image file format) copy and one digital LAS (log \nASCII) formatted copy. Digital logs may be submitted on a standard CD, DVD, or attached to an email sent to \ndigitallogs@nd.gov \n   \nThank you for your cooperation.  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nSincerely,  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nNathaniel Erbele  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nPetroleum Resource Specialist\n\nFrom WH\nFrom WH\nSacks\n5(48,5('\u0003$77$&+0(176\u001d\u0003\u0003&HUWLILHG\u0003VXUYH\\RU\nV\u0003SODW\u000f\u0003KRUL]RQWDO\u0003VHFWLRQ\u0003SODW\u000f\u0003HVWLPDWHG\u0003JHRORJLFDO\u0003WRSV\u000f\u0003proposed mud/cementing plan,\n6XUYH\\V\u0003DUH\u0003UHTXLUHG\u0003DW\u0003OHDVW\u0003HYHU\\\u0003\u0016\u0013\u0003IHHW\u0003LQ\u0003WKH\u0003EXLOG\u0003VHFWLRQ\u0003DQG\u0003HYHU\\\u0003\u001c\u0013\u0003IHHW\u0003LQ\u0003WKH\u0003ODWHUDO\u0003VHFWLRQ\u0003RI\u0003D\u0003KRUL]RQWDO\u0003ZHOO\u0011\u0003\u00030HDVXUHPHQW\u0003\nLQDFFXUDFLHV\u0003DUH\u0003QRW\u0003FRQVLGHUHG\u0003ZKHQ\u0003GHWHUPLQLQJ\u0003FRPSOLDQFH\u0003ZLWK\u0003WKH\u0003VSDFLQJ\u0012GULOOLQJ\u0003XQLW\u0003ERXQGDU\\\u0003VHWEDFN\u0003UHTXLUHPHQW\u0003H[FHSW\u0003LQ\u0003WKH\u0003\nIROORZLQJ\u0003VFHQDULRV\u001d\u0003\u0003\u0014\f\u0003:KHQ\u0003WKH\u0003DQJOH\u0003EHWZHHQ\u0003WKH\u0003ZHOO\u0003ERUH\u0003DQG\u0003WKH\u0003UHVSHFWLYH\u0003ERXQGDU\\\u0003LV\u0003\u0014\u0013\u0003GHJUHHV\u0003RU\u0003OHVV\u001e\u0003RU\u0003\u0015\f\u0003,I\u0003,QGXVWU\\\u0003VWDQGDUG\nPHWKRGV\u0003DQG\u0003HTXLSPHQW\u0003DUH\u0003QRW\u0003XWLOL]HG\u0011\u0003\u0003&RQVXOW\u0003WKH\u0003DSSOLFDEOH\u0003ILHOG\u0003RUGHU\u0003IRU\u0003H[FHSWLRQV\u0011\n\u0003\n,I\u0003PHDVXUHPHQW\u0003LQDFFXUDFLHV\u0003DUH\u0003UHTXLUHG\u0003WR\u0003EH\u0003FRQVLGHUHG\u000f\u0003D\u0003\u0015\u0083\u00030:'\u0003PHDVXUHPHQW\u0003LQDFFXUDF\\\u0003ZLOO\u0003EH\u0003DSSOLHG\u0003WR\u0003WKH\u0003KRUL]RQWDO\u0003SRUWLRQ\u0003RI\u0003WKH\u0003ZHOO\u0003\nERUH\u0011\u0003\u00037KLV\u0003PHDVXUHPHQW\u0003LQDFFXUDF\\\u0003LV\u0003DSSOLHG\u0003WR\u0003WKH\u0003ZHOO\u0003ERUH\u0003IURP\u0003.23\u0003WR\u00037'\u0011\nDrilling Mud Type (Lateral)\nDrilling Mud Type (Vertical Hole -

The Commission is very \nconcerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry. \n \nEffective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the \nwell is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations \nare conducted.  The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an \nauthorized facility.  Such containers must be: \n\uf0b7 \nleakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container \n\uf0b7 \ncovered to prevent precipitation from entering the container \n\uf0b7 \nplacard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container \n \nIf the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but \nonly upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request. \n \nAs previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01 \nstates in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production \nwastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste \nManagement.
