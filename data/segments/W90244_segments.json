The NDIC requires that all\noffsite high pressure injection pipelines for saltwater disposal wells be tested for mechanical integrity on an\nannual basis. The required pipeline pressure test procedure is as follows:\n1) Injection pipeline pressure test must be witnessed by an NDIC Field Inspector. Contact the\nappropriate NDIC Field Inspector to schedule the test.\n2) Pressure line to 100 psi above maximum injection pressure or 100 psi over the maximum\noperating pressure of the line whichever is greater. The duration of the pressure test must\nbe at least 30 minutes. Be sure to note the starting and ending pressures and the pressure at 5\nminute intervals lor the duration of the test\n3) Depending on the results as determined by the NDIC:\na, It may be necessary to shut in the pressurized line for 24 hours to stabilize temperature\nof test fluid and allow any air or gases to accumulate in order to be purged.\nb. Following the 24 hour shut-in period, re-pressurize line and document the amount of\nfluid needed to return pressure lo 100 psi above maximum injection pressure.\nc.

The injection pump will send water to both the BWL SWD and Buck Shot SWD. There will \nbe a pressure transducer at the outlet of the pump that limits the maximum pressure of the discharge to the \npermitted pressure. This pressure transducer will communicate to the VFD that controls the pump to \nmaximize the efficiency of the pump as well as shut it off at the max allowable pressure. There will be 2 \nflow meters after the tee in the discharge line, one for the BWL SWD and the other for the Buck Shot \nSWD. \nThe flowline to the Buck Shot wellhead will tap into the existing 6 inch flexsteel pipe that is currently in \noperation for the BWL SWD. This flowline is rated for 2250 psi, approximately 700 psi above the \nmaximum allowable pressure for the Buck Shot SWD. The lease operator will be on location on a daily \nbasis to monitor both SWD locations and the flowline that feeds both the BWL SWD and Buck Shot \nSWD. \nThe wellhead and horizontal lateral of the Oasis-operated Lewis Federal 5300 31-31 H well is within the \n114 mile area of review but no corrective action is required as the lateral of the Lewis Federal5300 31-31H \nis completed within the Bakken Formation which is separated from the Dakota Group by the Swift \nconfining layer and several thousand feet of other impermeable shales. \nThe horizontal lateral ofthe Oasis-operated Gramma Federal5300 41-31T well is within the 114 mile area \nof review but no corrective action is required as this lateral was drilled within the Bakken Formation \nwhich is separated from the Dakota Group by the Swift confining layer and several thousand feet of other \nimpermeable shales. The vertical portion of the Gramma Federal5300 41-31 T lies outside of the 114 mile \nAOR for the Buck Shot SWD. \nThe proposed Buck Shot SWD is needed to provide a more local disposal facility in the area to reduce \ncosts and ease the burden on regional disposal wells, it will supplement the existing BWL SWD. The \nanticipated initial injection rate of the well will be 5,000 bwpd at 1,000 psig pressure. However, this rate \nmay increase with additional drilling in the area, subject to the maximum pressure ceiling.\n\nFried, Stephen J. \nFrom: \nSent: \nMike Brown <mbrown@oasispetroleum.com> \nThursday, June 27, 2013 5:01 PM \nTo: \nFried, Stephen J. \nSubject: \nUpdated Buck Shot SWD numbers \nStephen, \nHere is the requested information.

The\ncasing will be set at a depth pre-approved by the NDIC per the Application for Permit to Drill NDAC 43-02-03-21, No\nsaltwater will be used In the drilling and cementing operations of the surface casing. Once the surface casing Is\ncemented, a piug or mechanical seal will be placed at the top of the casing to preveytany foreign matter from getting\ninto the well. A rig capable of drilling to TD will move onto the location within the \u2018sdhiavs previously dutlined to\ncomplete the drilling and casing plan as per the APD. The undersigned states that this request for suspension of\ndrilling operations in accordance with the Subsection 4 of Section 43-02.03-55 of the NDAC, is being requested to\ntake advantage of the cost savings and time savings of using an Initlal rig that is smaller than the rig necessary to\ndrill a well to total depth butis-net-intended-to-alter-oroxiend the torme-and-concitions of, ersuepend-eny obtigation\n| Oasis\nHl Petroleum North America LLC understands NDAC 43-02-03-31 requirements regarding confidentiality pertaining to\nHl this permit.

The section\nconsists of a sequence of alternating sand, silt and shale. Individual sand layers\ncan be up to 50\u00b0 thick and display a porosity of 20-25%. In the Lindvig 3-14 this\nsection is quite laminated and shows a higher sand percentage toward the base of\nthe section. Sands are generally poorly sorted and vary from fine to coarse\ngrained,\n\nUpper Unit: \u2018The Skull Creek/Newcastlc is predominantly medium gray shale and is\ninterbedded with thin layers of siltstone and sandy siltstone. It is about 250\u2019 in\nthe Lindvig 3-14 well,\n\nLower Unit: The Swift Shale consists of gray shales in the upper portion. These shales\nbecome interbedded with limestones and sandy limestones lower in the\nsection. [t is 460\u00b0 in the Lindvig 3-14.\n\nExhibit 3\u2014 Proposed Injection Program\n\nJune 13, 2012\n\nBuck Shot SWD $300 31-31\n\nOasis Petroleum North America, LLC\n\nSection 31, T153N R100W\n\nMcKenzie County, North Dakota\n\nApplication for Fluid Injection\n\nPROPOSED INJECTION PROGRAM\n\nThe Buck Shot SWD 5300 31-31 well will be used to inject produced water from wells in the Indian Hills\narea - Oasis Bakken and Three Forks wells already on production, in the process of completion, and those\nsoon to be drilled in the four township area of 152-153N and 100-101 W into the Dakota formation,\nInjection depths will be determined after the well is drilled and logged.\n\nThe Buck Shot SWD will utilize the existing tanks and pump facilities of the Oasis-operated BWL SWD\n5201 11-3. The injection pump will send water to both the BWI SWI) and Buck Shot SWD. \u2018There will\nbe a pressure transducer at the outlet of the pump that limits the maximum pressure of the discharge to the\npermitted pressure. This pressure transducer will communicate to the VFD that controls the pump to\nmaximize the efficiency of the pump as well as shut it off at the max allowable pressure. There will be 2\nflow meters after the tee in the discharge line, one for the BWI. SWD and the other for the Buck Shot\nSWD,\n\nThe flowline to the Buck Shot wellhead will tap into the existing 6 inch flexsteel pipe that is currently in\noperation for the BWL SWD, This flowline is rated for 2250 psi, approximately 700 psi above the\nmaximum allowable pressure for the Buck Shot SWD. The lease operator will be on Jocation on a daily\nbasis to monitor both SWD locations and the flowline that feeds both the BWL SWD and Buck Shot\nSWD,\n\nThe wellhead and horizontal lateral of the Oasis-operated Lewis Federal 5300 31-31H well is within the\nYa mile area of review but no corrective action is required as the lateral of the Lewis Federal $300 31-3111\nis completed within the Bakken Formation which is separated from the Dakota Group by the Swift\nconfining laycr and several thousand feet of other impermeable shales.\n\nThe proposed Buck Shot SWD is needed to provide a more local disposal facility in the area to reduce\ncosts and case the burden on regional disposal wells, it will supplement the existing BWL SWD. The\nanticipated initial injection rate of the well will be 5,000 bwpd at 1,000 psig pressure. However, this rate\nmay increase with additional drilling in the area, subject to the maximum pressure ceiling,\n\nExhibit 4 - Fresh Water Analysis\nASTRO-CHEM LAB, INC.\n4102 2nd Ave, West Williston, North Dakota 58802-9972, Phone: (701) 572-7355\nP.O.
