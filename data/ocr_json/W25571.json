Nabors B22 drilling the Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC - Colville 5301 44-12T \nduring July and August, 2013 in the Baker Field, McKenzie County, North Dakota. \n(G. Wayne Peterson, Sunburst Consulting) \n \nINTRODUCTION  \n \nOasis Petroleum North America, LLC. Colville 5301 44-12T [SE SE Sec. 12-T153N-R101W] is \nlocated approximately 3 miles south of Williston in McKenzie County, North Dakota. The \nColville 5301 44-12T is a horizontal Three Forks development well in part of Oasis Petroleum\u2019s \nCamp prospect within the Williston Basin. The vertical hole was planned to be drilled to \napproximately 10,333\u2019. The curve would be built at 12 degrees per 100\u2019 to land within the Three \nForks. This well is a two section lateral which originates in the southeast quarter of section 12, \nthen drilled south across section 13, to the southeast quarter of section 24 (Figure 2). Directional \ndrilling technologies and geo-steering techniques were used to land in the upper Three Forks \nreservoir and maintain exposure to the ideal target rock. \n \nOFFSET WELLS  \n \nThe primary offset wells used for depth correlation during curve operations were the Gulf Oil \nExploration and Production, Lindvig 1-11-3C; and the Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC \nAsh Federal 5300 11-18T. The Gulf Oil Exploration and Production, Lindvig 1-11-3C [SE SE \nSec. 11, T153N, R101W] is located approximately \u00bd of a mile west of the Colville 5301 44-12T. \nThis well was completed in March of 1982 reached a total depth of 13,800\u2019 true vertical depth \n(TVD).

The \nformation thicknesses expressed by gamma signatures in these wells, and the Oasis Petroleum \nNorth America, LLC Larry 5301 44-12B [SE NE Section 12, T153N, R101W] were used to \nassist in landing the curve. This was accomplished by comparing gamma signatures from the \noffset wells to gamma data collected during drilling operations. The casing target landing was \nperiodically updated to ensure accurate landing of the curve. Data used in this evaluation are \nincluded as an appendix to this report.  \n \n \n \nFigure 2.

This limestone was tan to gray tan, light brown \ngray, occasional light brown, rare off white lime mudstone. This facies was microcrystalline, \nfirm, with an earthy to crystalline texture, as well as contained traces of disseminated pyrite. \nAlso noted in certain areas was a trace light brown oil stain; possible earthy to intercrystalline \nporosity may have been present \n \nThe Mission Canyon Formation [Mississippian Madison Group] was logged at 9,420' MD 9,419' \nTVD (-7,334') SS. The Mission Canyon Formation consisted of lime mudstone that was \ndescribed as light brown, light gray brown to brown, occasional cream, rare light gray, trace off \nwhite to white in color.  The Mission Canyon was predominately friable to firm, dense with an \nearthy to crystalline texture. Some intervals were trace siliceous with traces of disseminated"

Limestone with spotty light to medium brown staining from the Mission Canyon Formation. \n \nThe Upper Bakken Shale Member [Mississippian-Bakken Formation] was drilled at 10,762' MD \n10,699' TVD (-8,614') SS. Entry into this member was characterized by high gamma, elevated \nbackground gas and increased rates of penetration. The black carbonaceous and petroliferous \nshale was sub blocky and firm with an earthy texture.  Trace minerals were observed to include \ndisseminated pyrite and calcite fracture fill. Hydrocarbons evaluated in this interval reached a \nmaximum of 305 units. \n \nThe Bakken Middle Member [Mississippian-Devonian] was reached at 10,792' MD 10,715' TVD \n(-8,630') SS. This formation was predominantly siltstone and silty sandstone noted by the \ndecreasing penetration rates, gamma API counts, and recorded gas levels, relative to the \noverlying source rock. The siltstone was light gray, sub-platy to sub-blocky, with an earthy \ntexture. It was moderately calcite cemented, with traces of disseminated pyrite. Also present was \nsilty sandstone which was light gray, light gray tan, rare buff, firm, very fine grained, well \nsorted, friable, sub-angular to sub-round, and contained possible intergranular porosity. It was \nmoderately calcite cemented. Trace minerals included disseminated and nodular pyrite. Drilling \ngas in this interval reached a maximum of 145 units, with a connection gas of 256 units. Also \nobserved was spotty light brown spotty oil stain."

Additionally this facies was friable and dense with an \nearthy texture. It also contained a trace of disseminated and nodular pyrite. Possible \nintercrystalline porosity was observed, as was a rare to a trace of light brown spotty oil stain. \nPresent in varying amounts was light gray to off white, rare light green shale which was friable \nto firm, sub-blocky with an earthy texture. Trace of nodular and disseminated pyrite was noted in  \nthe shale which contained no visible porosity. \n \nGas Show  \n \nGas monitoring and fluid gains provided evidence of a hydrocarbon saturated reservoir during \nthe drilling of the Yukon 5301 41-12T. Oil and gas shows at the shakers and in samples were \ncontinuously monitored. In the closed mud system, hydrostatic conditions were maintained near \nbalance, this allowed for gas and fluid gains from the well to be evaluated. Gas on the Colville \n5301 44-12T varied according to stratigraphic position and penetration rates which may have \nreflected increased porosity. Background concentrations ranged from 300 to 600 units, and \nconnection peaks of 1,000 to 1,200 units were observed in the middle of the target zone. A trip at \n19,527\u2019 MD, yielded a trip gas of 1,545 units. Chromatography of gas revealed typical \nconcentrations of methane, ethane, propane and butane characteristic of Bakken and Three Forks \ngas (Figure 7).   \n \n \n \nFigure 7.

Profile displaying total gas, gamma ray and rate of penetration.  \n \nGeo-steering \n \nRyan Energy Technologies provided personnel and equipment for measurement-while-drilling \n(MWD) services. The RPM directional drillers MWD and Sunburst Consulting personnel \nworked closely together throughout the project to evaluate data and make steering decisions to \nmaximize the amount of borehole in the targeted zones and increase rate of penetration (ROP) of \nthe formation.  \n \nThe 873\u2019 curve was drilled in 24 hours with bit #2 a Security FXD55D, attached to a 2.38 degree \nfixed NOV 7/8 5 stage mud motor and MWD tools. The curve was successfully landed at \n11,173\u2019 MD, approximately 25\u2019 into the Three Forks Formation. Seven inch diameter 32# HCP-\n110 casing was set to 11,144\u2019 MD.  \n \nGeologic structure maps of the Colville 5301 44-12T and surrounding control wells, estimated \nformational dip to move down at approximately -0.3\u00ba initially, then reverse due to a plunging \nsyncline at about 2,500\u2019, reversing to an estimated 0.5\u00ba  to 1.0\u00ba  until total depth (TD) was \nreached.  The Colville 5301 44-12T preferred drilling interval consisted of an eight foot zone \nlocated approximately sixteen feet into the Three Forks Formation. Stratigraphic position in the \ntarget zone was based on penetration rates, gas shows, gamma ray data and sample observations. \nThe projected target landing was to be sixteen feet into the Three Forks and was successfully \nreached prior to casing operations. Using offsets provided by Oasis representatives, projected \nporosity zones were identified as the preferred drilling areas (Figure 9)."

    "text": "SUMMARY  \n \nThe Colville 5301 44-12T is a successful well in Oasis Petroleum\u2019s horizontal Three Forks \ndevelopment program in Baker Field. The project was drilled from surface casing to TD in 21 \ndays. The TD of 21,090\u2019 MD was achieved at 1720 hours CDT August 12, 2013. The well site \nteam worked well together maintaining the well bore in the desired target interval for 76% of the \nlateral, opening 10,141\u2019 of potentially productive reservoir rock. \n \nDiesel invert drilling fluid 9.5-10.1 ppg for the vertical hole and 10.15-10.4 ppg for curve \noperations were used to maintain stable hole conditions, minimize washout through the salt \nintervals and permit adequate analysis of mud gas concentrations.  \n \nSamples in the Three Forks were commonly dolomite which is tan, cream, occasional light \nbrown, rare light gray tan, trace light gray. Additionally this facies was friable and dense with an \nearthy texture. It also contained a trace of disseminated and nodular pyrite. Possible \nintercrystalline porosity was observed, as was a rare to a trace of light brown spotty oil stain. \nPresent in varying amounts was light gray to off white, rare light green shale which was friable \nto firm, sub-blocky with an earthy texture. Trace of nodular and disseminated pyrite was noted, \nand the shale contained no visible porosity. \n \nGas on the Colville 5301 44-12T varied according to penetration rates and stratigraphic position \nof the well bore. Observed concentrations of background gas ranged from 300 to 600 units, and \nconnection peaks of 1,000 to 1,200 units were observed in the middle portion of formation while \ndrilling in the lateral where shows were the best. A trip at 19,527\u2019 MD, yielded a trip gas of \n1,545 units \n \nThe Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC. Colville 5301 44-12T awaits completion operations \nto determine its ultimate production potential.  \n \nRespectfully submitted,  \n \nG.
