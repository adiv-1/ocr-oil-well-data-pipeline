Services provided \nincluded; morning reports, evening reports, noon and midnight reports, sample \nexamination, sample recording via pictures, production of vertical and horizontal mudlog, \ngeo steering, sample collection and bagging, sample mailing and a final end of well \nreport. \n \n2.1.1 Geosteering \n \nOur offset GR TVD logs were from the Wade Federal 5300 21-30H well, located on the \nsame well pad as Wade Federal 5300 41-30 9B. Within the Middle Bakken, the primary \nobjective was to stay near the middle gamma markers which marks the inter layering \nbetween dolomitic siltstone and limy sandstones. Gamma patterns were compared with \nthe offset log and a TVD log was created while landing the curve to in order to land in \nthe targeted zone.  Steering in the lateral was accomplished by calculating dip from \nrelevant gamma markers, as well as by using lithology, total gas and ROP to determine \nour position within the formation. \n \n2.1.2 Gamma and Surveys \n \nGamma and survey MWD services were provided by Schlumberger/Pathfinder.  The \nmajority of the well was drilled within the target area of the Middle Bakken.   \n \n2.2 Mud Logging (Columbine Logging, Inc.) \n \n2.2.1 Sample Examination \n \nSamples were collected every 30 ft in the straight hole and build section, and every 30 ft \nwhile drilling the lateral. Descriptions included; mineralogy, color, firmness, argillaceous \ncontent, structure, texture, allochems, porosity, oil stain, and hydrocarbon fluorescence. \nCarbonate identification was determined with 10% dilute HCl-, alizarin red and \ncalcimeter. Hydrocarbon fluorescence was determined using a fluoroscope with a UV \nlamp.   \n \n2.2.2 Gas Detection \n \nGas was logged using a Bloodhound total gas/chromatograph system. The gas detection \nsystem uses an infra-red detector to measure total gas and the chromatograph separates \nand measures gases C1, C2, C3, iC4 and nC4. Gas was recorded in units where 1 unit \nequals 100 ppm. The gas detection system measured gases: C1, C2, C3, IC4, NC4, H2S, \nO2 and CO2."

    "text": "The Bloodhound Gas Detection and Chromatograph system use digital signal processing \ntechniques and non-dispersive infrared and chemical sensors for gas detection.  The \nsystem uses a proprietary chromatograph, which has the capability to detect from 0 to \n10,000 gas units.  This translates as 0 to 100% typical naturally-occurring hydrocarbon \ngas mixtures.  Calibration is performed using National Institute of Standards and \nTechnology (NIST) traceable calibration gases.  Lab calibration points include 0%, 2.5%, \nand 100% pure methane.  Complete immunity to saturation or damage in the presence of \nhigh concentrations of both light and heavy hydrocarbon gases precludes the necessity of \nconstant re-calibration or zero referencing. This allows the Bloodhound to react to \nhydrocarbon based gases from zero to 100% in concentration without dilution. \n \nLag time was approximated from a calculation of annular velocity based on: pump \noutput, open-hole diameter, cased hole diameter, collar diameter, drill pipe diameter and \nbottom hole assembly. Connection gases were monitored to confirm lag time calculations \nand thereby adjust lag time when needed. \n \n3.0 GEOLOGY \n \n3.1 Formation Tops Formation tops were picked using ROP, lithology, and gamma ray to identify markers in the \ncurve and lateral (Table 3.1).  \nFORMATION TOPS \nFormation/Marker Beds \nACTUAL \nPrognosis \nVertical Section \nTop MD (ft) \nTop TVD (ft) \nTHICKNESS (ft) \nDifference (ft) \nTVD KB/DF(ft) \nTVDSS \n(ft) \nKibbey Lime \n8344 \n8344 \n148 \n-2 \n8342 \n-6266 \nCharles Salt \n8492 \n8492 \n684 \n9 \n8501 \n-6425 \nBase Last Salt \n9176 \n9176 \n209 \n-16 \n9160 \n-7084 \nMission Canyon \n9385 \n9385 \n549 \n-10 \n9375 \n-7299 \nLodgepole \n9934 \n9934 \n731 \n-11 \n9923 \n-7847 \nFalse Bakken \n10785 \n10665 \n9 \n-15 \n10650 \n-8574 \nUpper Bakken Shale \n10808 \n10674 \n19 \n-11 \n10663 \n-8587 \nMiddle Bakken \n10868 \n10693 \n~41 \n-15 \n10678 \n-8602 \nMiddle Bakken (Top of Target) \n10868 \n10709 \n11 \n-19 \n10690 \n-8614 \nMiddle Bakken (Base of target) \n10868 \n10720 \n  \n-19 \n10701 \n-8625 \nLower Bakken Shale \n  \n  \n  \n  \n10714 \n-8638 \nTable 3.1 Wade Federal 5300 41-30 9B Formation Tops \n \n3.2 Lithology \nSample analysis began at 8,000\u2019 MD in the Otter Formation.   \n \n3.3 Formation Dip \nThe formation had an average dip of 89.5\u03bf.   \n \n3.4 Shows \nThe vertical-build section was drilled with invert mud and the lateral was drilled with \nbrine/production water.

Tool error is not required pursuant to order. \n \nPERMIT STIPULATIONS: Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for filter sock disposal must be \nmaintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-\nback whenever filtration operations are conducted.  Due to drainage adjacent to the well site, a dike is required surrounding the \nentire location.  OASIS PETROLEUM NORTH AMERICA LLC must take into consideration NDAC 43-02-03-28 (Safety \nRegulation) when contemplating simultaneous operations on the above captioned location.  Pursuant to NDAC 43-02-03-28 \n(Safety Regulation) \u201cNo boiler, portable electric lighting generator, or treater shall be placed nearer than 150 feet to any \nproducing well or oil tank.\u201d  OASIS PETRO NO AMER must contact NDIC Field Inspector Richard Dunn at 701-770-3554 \nprior to location construction. \n \nDrilling pit \nNDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that \u201ca pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well drilling and completion \noperations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will prevent pollution of the land surface and \nfreshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits are prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized \nrepresentative of the director prior to lining and use.  Drill cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director \nprior to placement in a cuttings pit.\u201d \n \nForm 1 Changes & Hard Lines  \n  Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.  The proposed directional \nplan is at a legal location.  The minimum legal coordinate from the well head at casing point is: 561\u2019S.   Also, based on the azimuth of the \nproposed lateral the maximum legal coordinate from the well head is: 1061\u2019S and 10042\u2019E. \n \nLocation Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period) \n   Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the approved drilling permit \non the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report.   If circumstances require operations to commence before the 3rd business day following \npublication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may be waived by the Director.  Application for a waiver must be by sworn \naffidavit providing the information necessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and \nany other information that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the drilling permit, \nthe applicant should retain the permit. \n \nPermit Fee & Notification \n   Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card .The permit fee has been received.  It is requested that notification be given \nimmediately upon the spudding of the well.  This information should be relayed to the Oil & Gas Division, Bismarck, via telephone.  The \nfollowing information must be included:  Well name, legal location, permit number, drilling contractor, company representative, date and \ntime of spudding.  Office hours are 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is (701) 328-\n8020, leave a message if after hours or on the weekend."

Surveys must be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a \nform approved by the director. However, the director may require the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the \nsurvey is needed to conduct the operation of the director's office in a timely manner.  Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one \nadobe document, with a certification cover page to certsurvey@nd.gov.    \nSurvey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.  \nSpecifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve (or when sliding) and 90 \nfeet in the lateral. \n \nSurface casing cement \n \nTail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12 hours, and tail cement \nutilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi before drilling the plug or initiating tests.   \n \nLogs \n \nNDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of (1) a suite of open hole logs from which formation tops and porosity zones \ncan be determined, (2) a Gamma Ray Log run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore, and (3) a log from which the \npresence and quality of cement can be determined (Standard CBL or Ultrasonic cement evaluation log) in every well in which production \nor intermediate casing has been set, this log must be run prior to completing the well.  All logs run must be submitted free of charge, as \none digital TIFF (tagged image file format) copy and one digital LAS (log ASCII) formatted copy. Digital logs may be submitted on a \nstandard CD, DVD, or attached to an email sent to digitallogs@nd.gov \n   \nThank you for your cooperation.  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nSincerely,  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nAlice Webber  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nEngineering Tech"
