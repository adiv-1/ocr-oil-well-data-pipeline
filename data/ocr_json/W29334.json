    "text": "Drilling began with a 6\u2033 Halliburton PDC bit, Ryan Directional Services MWD tools, and 1.5\u00b0 \nadjustable Baker Hughes mud motor.  This assembly drilled to 15,484\u2019 MD where a trip was \nmade due to low penetration rates.  Another complete assembly drilled to 17,597\u2019 MD, where \nat 23:30 CDT on June 2, 2015 the wellbore made contact with the upper Bakken shale at \n17,540\u2019 MD, 10,766\u2019 TVD (-8,698\u2019).  A sidetrack was initiated at 17,420\u2019 MD, using the same \nassembly, and successfully kicked off.  After the sidetrack, drilling continued to 20,149\u2019 MD \nwhere another trip was made due to slowing penetration rates.  A new motor was picked up \nand the well later reached its total depth at 20,450' MD, at 08:45 CDT on June 6, 2015, \ngenerating an exposure of 9,568\u2019 linear feet of 6\u2033 hole through the Middle Bakken Member. \nThe bottom hole location lies 111.86\u2019 south & 9,932.10' east of surface location or \napproximately 1,071.86' FNL & 296.01\u2019 FEL, NE NE Section 17, T153N, R100W. \n \nGEOLOGY \n \nLithology \n \nSunburst Geology, Inc. was not present for the vertical and curve sections, therefore no \nlithology is discussed prior to the Middle Bakken Member. \n \nMiddle Bakken Member  \n \nThe Middle Bakken Member was penetrated at 10,882\u2019 MD, 10,727\u2019 TVD (-8,659\u2019). The \nmiddle member in this locality is generally composed of a light gray-brown to light gray, very \nfine to fine grained, moderately to well cemented, calcite cemented silty sandstone. It was \napparent that samples observed higher in the member were often light brown, off white to \ncream colored, while the lower portion of the member was predominantly darker, gray-brown. \nThroughout the lateral, trace amounts of both disseminated and nodular pyrite were observed.  \nSamples also displayed trace, poor to fair intergranular porosity and trace spotty and \noccasionally even, light brown oil staining (Figure 2). \n  \n \nFigure 2.

    "text": "Geosteering \n \nThe potential pay zone for the Kline Federal 5300 11-18 2B was identified by evaluating \ngamma data collected while drilling the Oasis Petroleum, Kline Federal 5300 41-18 11 T2, \nand the steering practices from the Oasis Petroleum, Kline Federal 5300 11-18 5B. The target \nwas determined to be 12\u2019 thick, and located 12\u2019 below the Upper Bakken Shale and 20\u2019 above \nthe Lower Bakken Shale. The Middle Bakken Member displayed gamma counts ranging from \n70 to 140 (API). The target was identified by having a higher gamma marker at the very top of \ntarget, moderate markers throughout the target zone and a cool marker at the base (Figure 3). \nDespite a single, upper shale strike, geologists were successful in exposing 9,568' of potentially \nproductive Middle Bakken Member the well bore. The well was within the targeted zone for \n67% of the lateral.   \n \n \nFigure 3. Gamma characteristics observed throughout the Middle Bakken \nMember while drilling the Oasis Petroleum, Kline Federal 5300 41-18 11 T2. \n \nShale Strike Summary \n \nAt measured depths 16,750\u2019 through 16,820\u2019, erratic high gamma counts were logged. This \nhigh count anomaly was interpreted as being the warm gamma associated with being near the \ntop of target.  Given the well bore was descending at inclinations ranging from 88.9\u00ba to 88.2\u00ba \n(16,750\u2019 through 16,820\u2019), it was anticipated that this higher gamma would repeat as the well \nbore leveled off or slowly rose in zone. As the wells descent was controlled and the inclination \nraised above 90\u00ba (~17,050\u2019 MD), the dip profile displayed the well bore being ~3\u2019 from the top \nof target (13.5\u2019 from base of UBS).  From this point forward the well bore slowly rose in \nsection and geologists did not see any great concern with the well bore position, given that we \nhad yet to see any warm gamma signatures associated with the top of target. In addition, a \nmajority of the wells within this two-section corridor, drilling east, had a synclinal feature after \nthe halfway point of the lateral.  Between the surveys at 17,395\u2019 and 17,489\u2019 MD, the \ninclination increased from 89.9\u00ba to 91.7\u00ba. While sliding down to correct the ascending \ninclination gamma counts rose. It was at this time that decision to stop and circulate a bottoms-\nup was made. Samples from the bottoms up confirmed the Upper Bakken Shale had been \ncontacted."

    "text": "Gas and Oil Shows  \n \nHydrocarbon shows at the beginning of the lateral were relatively low.  During the first ~1,500\u2019 \nof lateral operations the well bore remained primarily near the base if not below the target \nzone. While drilling this interval background gasses rarely exceeded 1,000 units, but \nconnection, survey and slide gasses regularly exceeded 1,000 units.  Oil show throughout this \nperiod of drilling was moderate, with most cuttings reacting slowly with a pale yellow diffuse \ncut fluorescence. As the well bore reached the top of the target interval hydrocarbon shows \nincreased.  These brief periods of higher gas shows occurred three times while drilling along \nthe upper portion of the target zone (12,250\u2019- 12,510\u2019 MD, 13,200\u2019-13,950\u2019 MD, and 16,300\u2019-\n16,430\u2019 MD) (Figure 4).  Although these optimistic shows were intermittent, samples \ndisplayed a more promising oil staining that that observed in lower samples. Samples along \nthe upper portion displayed a light to medium brown even oil staining. Fluorescent cuts were \nalso slightly more promising than those observed lower in zone were. Cuts were described as: \nmoderate, pale yellow, streaming cut fluorescence. While drilling from 11,510\u2019 to 11,656\u2019 MD \nthere were issues with the gas detection, this caused low gas readings. When the system was \nrepaired, gas shows immediately climbed.  For the remainder of the well, despite of the well \nbeing high or low in zone, background gasses were low (400-1,200 units), while connection \ngasses occasionally exceeded 1,300 units. Unfortunately, due to heavy contamination from \nlubricants there were no cuts performed after 14,950\u2019 MD. Although hydrocarbon shows \nremained consistent despite of position within the target zone, the most promising oil staining \nremained in the upper most portion of the target interval.  \n \n \nFigure 4. Cross-sectional interpretation of the Kline Federal 5300 11-18 2B borehole with total gas units and \nestimated dip based on lithology, MWD data, drill rate, and regional structural data."

    "text": "SUMMARY \n \nThe Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC, Kline Federal 5300 11-18 2B lateral section was \ndrilled by Xtreme 21, from re-entry to total depth, in 7 days.  The well reached a total depth of \n20,450' MD on June 6, 2015. Geologic data, hydrocarbon gas measurements, and sample \nexamination indicate an encouraging Middle Bakken Member well.  Multiple sections of \nhigher gas were recorded through the lateral section. Positive connection and survey shows, \nexceeding 1,000 units, were recorded throughout the lateral. Samples from the target zone \nconsisted of light brown to off white, silty sandstone and yielded a moderate, pale yellow, \nstreaming cut fluorescence and poor to fair intergranular porosity.  The well was within the \ntargeted zone for 67% of the lateral and exposed 9,568' of potentially productive Middle \nBakken Member to the well bore.  The well currently awaits completion operations. \n \n  \nRespectfully submitted, \n \nRyan O\u2019Donnell \n \nWell Site Geologist \n \nSunburst Consulting, Inc. \n \nJune 6, 2015"

A few key points: \n1) We will move the rig to the Carson SWD pad once we have finished drilling the vertical portions of all 3 wells on \nthis pad. \n2) We will finish drilling the vertical portion of the third well, the Kline Federal 5300 11-18 2B, on April 9th. \n3) We will utilize a 2\"d rig to drill the lateral portions of the 3 wells on this pad. \n4) The 2\"d rig is currently drilling wells on a different pad and is scheduled to reach TD on the final well in late \nMay/early June, leaving a gap of approximately 55 days. \n5) We will be able to return to the Kline Federal 5300 11-18 pad on or before June 6th. \nGiven the time sensitive nature of this request, expedited review of these sundries would be greatly appreciated. \nThank you for your consideration, \nMichael P.

The \napproval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than \nthe 500' setback from the north & south boundaries and 200' setback from the east & west boundaries within \nthe 1280 acre spacing unit consisting of Sections 18 & 17, T153N R100W.  \n \nPERMIT STIPULATIONS: Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for \nfilter sock disposal must be maintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, and must \nremain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations are \nconducted.  In addition, OASIS PETROLEUM NORTH AMERICA LLC must take into consideration \nNDAC 43-02-03-28 (Safety Regulation) when contemplating simultaneous operations on the above \ncaptioned location.  Pursuant to NDAC 43-02-03-28 (Safety Regulation) \u201cNo boiler, portable electric \nlighting generator, or treater shall be placed nearer than 150 feet to any producing well or oil tank.\u201d  \nLastly, OASIS PETROLIUM NORTH AMERICA LLC must contact NDIC Field Inspector Richard \nDunn at 701-770-3554 prior to location construction. \n \nDrilling pit \nNDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that \u201ca pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well \ndrilling and completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will \nprevent pollution of the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits \nare prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized representative of the director prior to lining and use.  \nDrill cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings \npit.\u201d \n \nForm 1 Changes & Hard Lines  \n  Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.  \nThe proposed directional plan is at a legal location.  Based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum \nlegal coordinate from the well head is: 10028\u2019 E. \n \nLocation Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period) \n   Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the \napproved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report.   If circumstances require operations to \ncommence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may \nbe waived by the Director.  Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information \nnecessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other \ninformation that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the \ndrilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit."

The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an \nauthorized facility.
