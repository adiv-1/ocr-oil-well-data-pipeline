The Missouri River continues to rise and the possibility of additional \nflooding from the spring melt and recent rains in the near future exists. I urge you to closely monitor \nthese sites and take the necessary preventative actions to eliminate or mitigate environmental damage \nif these sites become deluged with flood waters. The following e-mail from Allen Schlag of the National \nWeather Service also addresses the current situation of the Missouri River in the Williston area: \n600 E Boulevard Ave - Dept 405, Bismarck, North Dakota 58505-0840 Phone (70 1)328-8020 Fax (701)328-8022\n\nFrom: Allen Schlag [mailto:allen.schlag@noaa.gov] \nSent: Monday, May 12, 2014 1:47 PM \nTo: WILLIAMS; Samuelson, Jerry O.; MCKENZIE; Anton, Amy J.; Ackerman, Laura C.; Engelhardt, Bruce \nW.; Travnicek, Andrea J.; Johnson, Sean M. \nSubject: Missouri River \nGreetings everyone \nJust a quick note on the Missouri River near Williston forecast site and the prospects for problems as \nwe go forward into latter half of May and early June {by default this also includes the Yellowstone in \nND as well). As you may have noticed already, the Missouri River near Williston crossed over into \nForecast Issuance Stage this past weekend before falling back below 20 ft. This, is temporary. While \nthe Corps released a statement last week tempering their runoff expectations for the Missouri River \noverall, the attached graphic of mountain snowpack suggests we still have a pretty strong runoff into \nthe Yellowstone and Missouri Rivers ahead of us. \nWe will most likely cross over above flood stage as measured at the Lewis and Clark Bridge west of \nWilliston at some point in the next couple of weeks. \nWhat exactly lies in store for the area with respect to eventual river stages is still quite unclear as the \noverall environment for the melt of the mountain snowpack is too far out. However ... there has been \na fairly wet pattern in the plains of Montana already this spring, with a mixed bag in the upper \nelevations of central MT. The region remains well above normal with respect to mountain snowpack, \nbut is also well below where 1997 and 2011 were at this point in time {see the second attached pdf). \nIf I had to take a wild guess this far in advance, something around the 22.5 to 24.5 ft range is \nreasonable, with any added big rains this could be expanded quite easily to the 25-26 ft range. \nHow exactly this will compare to this spring's ice jams and high water is a really good question, which I \ndon't have any easy answers to either. Suffice to say, I think there's a pretty decent chance that we \nwill see water roughly 4-6 ft higher than is currently in northwestern ND along both the Yellowstone \nand Missouri Rivers with the timing of near the last week of May to about the third week of June. \nHistorically, I know there have been some access issues with oil well sites in the Trenton area with \nwater levels in the 22 ft range at the Lewis and Clark Bridge. How much of this has been mitigated by \nring dikes or road raises, again ... very good question to which I have no answer. \nOf course, if you have any questions or just want to chat about this in greater detail, always feel free \nto give me a call. \nAllen \np.s. And as always, feel free to disseminate as you feel is appropriate. \nAllen J. Schlag Service Hydrologist \nWFO-Bismarck \nNational Weather Service \n2301 Univ. Drive, Bldg 27 \nBismarck, ND 58504 ph. 701-250-4495\n\nIf you have question in regards to flood preparation and prevention activities, please feel free to \ncontact me at your convenience. You can reach me at {701) 770-3554 or e-mail at rsdunn@nd.gov. \nThank you for your time and consideration. \nSincerely, \nRichard S. Dunn \nField Inspector"

Communication was lost with the producing zone during the\nworkover due to salt plugs in the various fish left in the well, See the attached wellbore schematic.\nApproximately $156,000 was spent trying to re-establish production fram the Red River. The well has salted off\nagain and is not productive. We propose to spot 30 sx Class 'S' cement an top of the Mode! 'D' packer to\npermanently abandon the Red River. Due to the tight casing in the Dunham, 6661\u2019, we can not get a retainer in\nthe well, and with out communication with the perfs, we can not get a squeeze.

Also, the well\nproduces from a well depth of more than 10,000 feet. During the\ntwelve consecutive months qualifying period January 1995 thru\nDecember 1995, the well produced at a maximum efficient rate, and\nthe average daily production from the well was 27.9 barrels of oil\nper day.\n\nIt is therefore determined that the above mentioned well\nqualifies as a \"Stripper Well Property\" pursuant to Section\n57-51.1-01 NDCC.\n\nThis determination is applicable only to the Red River Pool\nin and under said property.\n\nThe Commission shall have continuing jurisdiction, and shall\nhave the authority to review the matter.

The workover project was completed\non June 20, 1994 and meets the requirements set forth in North\nDakota Century Code Section 57-51.1-03.\nThe workover project was performed from June 13, 1994 to June 20,\n1994. The total cost of the project was $39,239. The average\ndaily production from the well prior to commencement of the\nworkover project from December 1993 through May 1994 was 24.53\nbarrels of oil per day. The average daily production from the well\nduring the first sixty days after completion of the project was\n72.37 barrels of oil per day.\nTherefore, it is determined the above listed well qualifies as a\nworkover project for tax exemption purposes.\nThe Commission shall have continuing jurisdiction, and shall have\nthe authority to review the matter. The determination may be\namended or rescinded by the Commission for good cause.\nSincerely,\nKent Petzer\nPetroleum Engineer\ncc: Tax Dept\n600 EAST BOUIEVARD, BISMARCK, NORTH DAKOTA 58505, PHONE (701) 224 2969 FAXI701) 224 3682"

The ignitor is not working and must be repaired as soon as\npossible. Additionally, there is an area around the production equipment\nthat is very weedy and is a potential fire hazard.\n\nRosebud #22-11 - ignitor was not working. Also weeds on the location that\nneed to be removed.\nBasic Corps of Engineers #31-10 - the drilling pit mud cuttings must be hauled\nout to an approved disposal pit and the drilling pit on location reclaimed\nimmediately.\nPlease take care of these problems as soon as possible.

OF THE OS\nBASIC EARTH SCIENCE SYSTEMS, INC. wo, ee\nBASIC CORP OF ENGINEERS 31-10 Sts\nWELL PAD AND ACCESS ROAD, : . \u201c\nMCKENZIE COUNTY, NORTH DAKOTA 7\nby\nJohn and Mavis Greer\nMani Sours (P.1.)\nProject No. ND-1946\nMarch 1986\nABSTRACT: An intensive cultural resource survey was conducted on the\narea surrounding a proposed well pad and access road. No cultural\nresources were found, and cultural clearance is recommended with no\nspecial stipulations.\nPROJECT LOCATION:\n_ Agency: Corp of Engineers, Riverdale\nUSGS Quad: Williston SW (7.5')\nWell Location: NW/NE (660 fnt, 2305 fel) Sec.10-T153N-R1OIW\nPublic Surface (5 acres surveyed) .\nAccess Route: NW/NE Section 10\n(0.11 miles surveyed, public surface)\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION: Construction is planned on a well pad (est. 300 x\n350\") and an access road (about 600 feet long). The access road leaves\nthe bladed county road just to the north and runs south on the west side\nof an irrigation canal to the well location. The well pad and access\nToad are staked in a plowed field which is currently in stubble. This\nflat area has been diked and is a controlled farming portion of the\nwide Missouri River floodplain.\n-1-\n\nPROJECT SETTING: The proposed well location is situated on the recent\nMissouri River floodplain, in a silty area currently in cultivation. A\nlarge major meander (now a large recreational lake) is just to the south-\neast, while the main Missouri River channel is to the north. Elevation\nof the wetl pad area is about 1850 feet.\nFILES SEARCH: The files of the North Dakota State Historical Society\nindicate that no previous surveys or cultural resources are known for\nthe project area. Previous surveys in adjacent and nearby areas include\nwell pad and access road surveys by Greer, a pipeline survey by Powers\nElevation, and seismograph line studies by the Corps of Engineers; all\nprevious studies have provided negative results. No subsurface monitor-\ning of construction to provide subsurface information has been reported\nin any surrounding or nearby areas.\nFIELD WORK: During the intensive cultural resource survey on 3/30/86 by\nJohn and Mavis Greer, the 5 acres surrounding the well pad were surveyed\nwith multiple transects with an average spacing of 70 feet. Ground\nvisibility was fair to poor, due to mostly dense stubble and grass cover.\nThe well location was staked,\nCULTURAL RESOURCES: No cultural resources have been reported from the\narea, and none were found during the present inspection. There were no\nsurface indications of buried cultural deposits within the project area.\nTwo small shovel tests dug to 1.5 feet deep within the well pad planned\nconstruction area also yielded negative results.\nRECOMMENDATIONS: It appears that no cultural resources will be affected\nby the proposed project, and no further work is recommended. If subsur-\nface cultural materials are found during construction, the head of the\nfederal permitting agency should be notified immediately. These recam-\nmendations are subject to the approval of the permitting agency.\nATTACHMENTS: Project map (USGS quad).\nCOLLECTIONS: None.\n\n-2-\n\nee OS\npe |\nao ECO\n\u2018 (= s <8  geee\nSe face a\na TS pease! fees.\u201d fe Poe Wee a\neo 4 eee ae ae A\\ AE WY BN SP | SEY\n4 LE peme eZ Geri oS a9 See ESO, Ay\noe ee Ne Sete AS .\nESN 74 : [VASA A rs fous ,} ere\nFOUN Paan Bs \u2018U fee cet 2 .\nRr A eee en need.) te i tg a 2 ees\nAF NR TNS Pant SN\nFigure 1, Portion of the Williston SW Quad (usasS 7.5'}, McKenzie County,\nNorth Dakota, showing the proposed Basic Corp of Engineers 31-10\nwell pad, access road, and S-acre survey area.

We estimate a minimum delay of one\nmonth before construction of the drill pad can begin. Since the frost should\nno longer be a factor by that time, we believe a conventional drill pad would\nbe acceptable, therefore, permission is requested to deviate from the\nrequirement to cover the pad with plastic and build the location up with dirt\naequired from a private source.\nThe Multi-Point Surface Use and Operation Plan should be amended as follows:\ny, Location of Existing and/or Proposed Facilities\nB.

Directions to the location from Williston, North Dakota are as\nfollows: Go south on Highway 85 6-1/4 miles, turn east on first\nexisting gravel road with stop sign controlling access, proceed east\n2 miles, turn south on gravel road 460' to wellsite access.\n2\n\nMULTI-POINT SURFACE USE AND OPERATIONS PLAN\n\nBe For access roads in relation to county roads, see Exhibit 1.1 with\nthe access of U.S. 85 highlighted in pink. This map shows all\ncounty roads within a three mile radius.\n\nCc. Exhibit 1.2 shows a detailed map of the existing roads. The first\ntwo miles of access off U.S. 85, marked in green, is a high quality\ngravel road. The following 460\u2018, marked in pink, is an existing\ngravel road with access onto the location.\n\nDd. Roads within a one-mile radius are shown on Exhibit 1.1.\n\nE. Existing roads will be maintained as necessary to allow access\nduring drilling and completion operations.\n\n2. Planned Access Roads\n\nReferencing Exhibit 1.2 and the through segments of road:\n\nA. Prior to drilling, the existing roads will be upgraded as follows:\n(1) Gravel Road (Exhibit 1.2, green) This segment of road is in\n\ngood condition. Basic Eartn Science Systems, Inc. has recently\nupgraded this road in conjunction with other activity in this\narea and will continue to keep this road maintained.\n\n(2) Gravel Road (Exhibit 1.2, pink) This existing gravel road will\nrequire no improvement and will only require that the accesses\nto the location be built.\n\nIf the well is completed as a dry hole, Lhe access will be\nreclaimed along with the rest of the location.\n\nIf the well is completed as a producer, the lease road will be\nupgraded as required and gravel added as needed.\n\nB. The maximum grade will be less than six percent, however, this may\nvary as topographical conditions vary.\n\nc. No turnouts are planned.\n\nD. No culverts are planned.\n\nE. Native surfacing material from construction of access road will be\nsufficient for drilling. No outside construction materials are\nanticipated, if additional material is needed, then it will be\nacquired from a private source and it will be free of noxious weeds.\n\nFY No gates, cattleguards or fence cuts will be necessary.\n\nG. No road will be built. The location will be accessed from the\nexisting gravel road.\n\n4\n\nMULTI-POINT SURFACE USE AND OPERATIONS PLAN\n3.

Basic Earth Science\nSystems, Inc. has no other facilities in the area.\n\nB. Exhibits 3 and 4 show the surveyed location and the anticipated cut\nand fill. Complying with the Corps of Engineers' requirement because\nof the frozen condition of the land, the wellsite will have the snow\nand vegetation bladed off down to the ground surface, a plastic\nliner laid on top and dirt added to level the location. The dirt\nwill be taken from the construction of the pit.\n\nCc. New facilities contemplated in the event of production are shown on\nExhibit 6.\n\n{1) Proposed tank battery and production equipment are as shown on\nExhibit 6 and are to be located adjacent to the existing road\nas shown on Exhibit 6. Said equipment will be bermed as per\nthe Army Corps of Engineers\u2019 requirement.\n\n(2) Dimension of the facilities are shown on Exhibit 6.\n\n(3) Construction will be to strip the topsoil, level drilling pad.\nThe battery site and treater pits will be constructed with soil\nmaterials native to the site. The additional material needed on\nsite will be acquired from a private source and will contain no\nnoxious weeds. Construction methods will be employed to assume\nthat no drainage flows are impounded to prevent the loss of any\nhydrocarbon from the site. This is to be done in a manner to\nfacilitate rapid recovery and clean up. (See Exhibit 6).\n\n\u2018Te\n\nMULTI-POINT SURFACE USE AND OPERATIONS PLAN\n(4) Protective measures to protect wildlife and livestock will be\ntaken as follows: the weights on the pumping unit will be\nenclosed and the production pit will be fenced.\n\nDe Upon completion of well, areas required for continued use will be\ngraded to provide drainage and minimize erosion. Those areas\nunnecessary for use will be graded to blend with the surrounding\ntopography. Top-soil will be replaced on those areas and seeded\nwith Brome grass or other mixture as required by the Corps of\nEngineers and the Nortn Dakota Game and Fish Department.\n\nSe Location and Type of Water Supply\n\nA. Fresh water for spudding and drilling the first 6500 feet will be\ntrucked to location over the roads shown on Exhibit 1.2. Salt water\nfor the salt-saturated mud system will be trucked from Williston.\n\nB. Salt and fresh water will be trucked to location over the roads\nmarked on Exhibit 1.2.\n\nC. No water well is to be drilled on this lease.\n\n6. Source of Construction Materials\n\nA. Exhibit 5 shows the layout of the planned pad for drilling purposes.\nThis layout represents the maximum area to be disturbed. If a\nsmaller drilling rig is available, the actual size of the location\nwill be reduced to minimize the area disturbed. Prior to leveling\noff the drilisite pad, the brush covering location will be scraped\ninto a pile on the southeast corner of the location. A sheet of\nplastic will be laid over the wellsite. Dirt removed from the pit\nwill be distributed on the plastic. The site will then be leveled\nand laid out as shown on Exhibit 5. If the well is productive, the\ndrillsite will be reclaimed and an area sufficient for the wellhead\nand a completion rig will be left at the proposed drilisite. The\nproduction equipment will then be installed as shown in Exhibit 6 .\nSaid production equipment and wellhead will be diked as required by\nthe Corps of Engineers. Gravel will then be placed on the\nproduction pad. Construction materials will consist of soil\nencountered within the boundaries of the proposed site. Gravel will\nbe used, as needed. The entire producing facility will be fenced\nwith a two strand barbless wire fence.\n\nB. The planned site and access roads are outleased to the North Dakota\nGane and Fish Department.\n\nc\n\nMULTI-POINT SURFACE USB AND OPERATIONS PLAN\n\nCc. All gravel (containing no noxiaus weeds) will be obtained from\nprivate land in quantities necessary for the access surfacing and\ntank base material on the battery site.\n\n7. Methods for Handling Waste Disposal\n\nThis well is being drilled to a depth of 6500 feet with fresh water.\n\nFrom that depth on salt water will be used. All cuttings and salt\n\nsaturated material generated will be hauled off location during and after\n\ncompletion of the well. Upon the completion of drilling operations, all\nwaste materials including, but not limited to drill cuttings, drilling\nfluids, and burned and unburned trash, shall be completely removed from\n\nGovernment land as directed by the Project Manager, Garrison Project. No\n\nwaste material shall be buried on site.\n\nA. All drill cuttings will be stored on site ina 20 mil plastic lined\npit during drilling and hauled off site prior to reclamation.\n\nB. All fresh water drilling Fluids will be removed from site or allowed\nto evaporate from the reserve pit.\n\nC. At.6500 feet we will be switching over to a brine system. All\nliquid and solid waste that is produced will be hauled from the\nsite, either during or immediately after drilling is completed. All\nwaste stored on location during drilling activities will be stored\nin steel containers or in an earthern dike lined with 20 mil plastic\nliner.\n\nDd. No substantial amount of produced water is expected while drilling.\nThe amount of hydrocarbon that may be produced while testing will be\nstored in a tank. The small amount of loss will be retained in the\nreserve pit. Previous to clean-up operations the hydrocarbon\nmaterials will be skimmed or removed as the situation would dictate.\n\nE. Sanitary facilities will consist of chemical toilets. Waste\nwill be contained and hauled from the site immediately following the\narilling operations.\n\n. F. Garbage and nonflammable waste are to be contained in the trash pit.\nFlammable waste is to be contained in the burn pit. The flammable\ntrash is to be burned periodically. The trash and/or burn pit will\nbe totally enclosed with small mesh wire to prevent wind scattering\nand wildlife entry. The pit will be fenced and flagged to prevent\nentry of livestock. All non-flammable trash will be hauled from\nsite prior to reclamation.\n\nc\n\n-MULTL=POINT SURFACE USE AND OPERATIONS PLAN\nGq. All trash, garbage, etc. is to be gathered and burned or hauled from\nthe site at the end of drilling operations. Reserve and mud pits\nwill be trenched as needed and allowed to dry after drilling is\ncompleted and then adequately filled and leveled. All garbage and\npits will be filled as soon as the rig leaves the location.\n8, Ancillary Facilities\nThere are no airstrips, camps or other facilities planned during the\ndrilling of the proposed well.\n9. Well Site Layout\nA. See Exhibit 5 for a cross section of the drill pad with cut and\nfills. Exhibit 5 shows that the location is relatively flat and\nthere will be approximately a three foot cut and one foot of fill on\nthe drill pad.\n\n. Be Rig layout is shown on Exhibit 7. No permanent living facilities\nare planned. However, during drilling operations, three trailers\nwill be on location.\n\nC. Location of mud \u00e9anks; reserve, burn and trash pits; pipe racks;\n\nand soil material stockpiles are shown on Exhibits 6 and 7.\n\n10. Plans for Restoration of Surface\nA, If well is completed as dry hole.\n\n(1) The reserve pit will be fenced until dry and all drill cuttings\nand salt saturated water material from the pits will be hauled, .\npits backfilled, leveled, and contoured. The brush pile will\nbe burned and reincorporated with the top soil. The top soil\nwill be redistributed and seeded.\n\n(2) If access road is not needed, it will be leveled, top soiled,\nand reseeded.\n\n(3) If there is oil in the pit, it will be removed immediately\nafter drilling.\n\n(4) Rehabilitation operations will begin immediately after the\ndrilling rig is removed. The trash and/or burn pits will de\neavered. Produced fluids will be removed or flagged overhead\nand fenced immediately. Reseeding and revegetation operations\nshall be accomplished in accordance with the instructions, and\nto the satisfaction, of the Project Manager, Garrison Project.\nThe entire reclamation process will be completed after the\nspring thaw of 1986.\n\nMULTI-POINT SURFACE USE AND OPERATIONS PLAN\n\nB. If the well is completed as a producer.\n\n(1) The pit will be trenched and backfilled as soon as possible and\nall excess liquids will be hauled off site.\n\n(2) The road will be upgraded as discussed in Section 2 and the\nproduction pad will be reduced in areal extent as discussed in\nSeetion 6.4. The area to be returned to the Game and Fish will\nbe reclaimed as soon as feasible after the well is completed.\nThe reclamation will consist of returning the ground to\noriginal contours and redistributing the top soil and seeding\nwith Brome grass or other seed mixtures as required vy the Game\nand Fish. The excess top soil pile will be seeded to prevent\nerosion.\n\n11. Other Information\n\nA. Topography: The location borders the Missouri River floodplain.\n\nB. The surface at the drillsite and on the access road is outleased to\nthe North Dakota Game and Fish Department. The surface settlement\nwith the Game and Fish is attached as Exhibit 12.\n\nCc. The nearest occupied dwelling is greater than a mile south of the\nsite.\n\nD. Tne nearest source for water is approximately 1/4 mile east of the\nlocation.\n\nE. An archeological survey is being conducted and will be submitted\nunder separate cover for inclusion in this application as Exhibit 8.\n\nFe Drilling is planned for February 1, 1986. It is anticipated that\ncasing point will be reached within 55 days after commencement of\ndrilling.\n\n12. Lessee's or Operator's Representative\n\nBasie Earth Science Systems, Inc.
