A tangent was drilled prior to casing to cross the western hard line and set in the Middle\nBakken approximately 18\u00b0 below the Upper Bakken Shale. 7\u201d intermediate casing was set at this\npoint to isolate the target reservoir. A single horizontal lateral in the Middle Bakken was |\nproposed to be drill into the NE \u201c4 of NW % of Section 25.\nI\n@ |"

A 13 4\"\nhole was drilled with fresh water to 2,187\u00b0 MD and isolated with 9 5/8\" 364 J-55 casing\ncemented to surface. On February 6, 2012 the Nabors 419 drilling rig reentered surface to begin\nvertical operations. Upon casing exit the drilling fluid was changed to diesel invert with a target\nweight of 9.9 to 9.7 ppg for use in the remaining vertical and curve. The area surrounding\nMagnum was a highly prosperous and weil developed Mission Canyon field. As a result.\nformational depletion resulted in the loss of 2.363 bbls of invert mud while drilling into the\nMission Canyon. The vertical was drilled to a preliminary KOP of 10.281? MD with 2 Ulterra\nbits. The first drilled from under casing to a MD of 8,502\u00b0 where it was pulled as planned for the\nKibbcy bit trip. The second Ulterra bit was replaced at 10.281\" MD which was the preliminary\nKOP.\nThe first bit drilled 6.322\u00b0 in 66.5 hours lor an average ROP of 95.06 fuhr. The second\ncompleted the vertical after drilling 1.779\" in 32 hours tor an average ROP of 55.59 fvhr. |\nVertical operations were completed on February 15, 2012.\nDIRECTIONAL OPERATIONS |\nSperry Sun provided equipment and personnel for MWD and directional services. Sunburst\nConsulting geologists worked closcly throughout the project with Sperry Sun to make steering\n@ decisions and maximize the amount of borehole in the pay zone. Attention was also paid lo\nproviding a smooth lateral well bore to case the implementation of the aggressive production\nfracture program. Tight adherence to the drill line was required to prevent any interference with\nfuture drill plans tor the section. As such, a window of no more then 25\u00b0 on either side of the line\nwas given, At its widest point the lateral departed the planned line by 20.22\" to the west.\nCurve Build\nThe curve build was to drill down 477\u00b0 TVD in 750\u00b0 MD and required 12 degrees of build per\n100\u00b0 (Figures 2 & 3). The curve was drilled with a single 8 3/4 PDC bit. After reaching 90 |\n| degrees a tangent section was put in place to cross the western hard line. After completing the\ntangent, 7\u00b0\u00b0 casing was set at 11.529\u00b0 MD. 10,808.58\" TVD, ~18\u00b0 below the Upper Bakken |\nShale. \u2018the single Security bit drilled 1.263\" in 86.94 hours for an average drilling rate of 14.52\n| fi/hr.\nThe Security FXD5SM combined with the Sperry directional motor drilled quickly while\n| providing predictable and generous build rates. The optimal performance of the curve assembly\nallowed for increased rotation whilst decreasing time spent on the build section.\nThe added benefit of predictable build rates made forecasting the TVD of the False Bakken and\ni Upper Bakken Shale trom penetration rates more reliable: this in turn allowed for on the fly\nadjustments to landing target and insured a landing within the desired objective. |\n@ |\nSUNBURST\n| CONSULTING\n- ~ a e \u2014 - \u2014 = cteroer senvice"

    "text": "|\n@ Marker 1): Marker 1) had very distinct drilling characteristics. The D marker began about 8\u00b0\nfrom the top of zone and in the lateral averaged a 95-100 cps gamma signature. The first and i\nmost notable change in drilling was seen at a TVD of 10,809\". A portion of the D marker would\ndrill as fast as 200 fi/hr, suggesting favorable porosity conditions: however, the interval was\nsmall and difficult to track. When the bit entered this \u201chigh speed zone\u2122 the bit would multiply\nthe angle at which it entered. This caused the bit to pass quickly through the interval despite the\nangle at which it was encountered, \u2018The D marker also had areas of ratty drilling that would cause\n| deflections down. Due primarily to uniform gamma that was seen in the 4\u00b0 segment that formed\nmarker D. the exact stratigraphic position where these deviations occurred could not be\ndetermined. The majority of the lateral was drilled within this marker and most of the increases \\\nin background gas can be scen while drilling this interval. The highest average background gas\nstarting around 18.000\u2019 MD was drilled within this interval.\nMarker E: Marker E ranged from 12\u00b0-13' TVD below the top of zone. This interval showed the\nmost variety in sample. At times trace amounts of lime packstone would be observed as well as\nincreased contents of sparry calcite and calcareous cement. In general truce fo rare spotty brown\noil staining was noted. Levels of hydrocarbon gas decreased when the well bore passed through\nthis interval. The drop in gas does coincide with a drop in porosity seen in samples and offset i\nporosity logs. |\nMarker F; Was found just below zone and shared sample characteristics of marker D. The twa\nzones were identical except for a subtle difference in benchmark gamma. The I) marker averaged |\nbetween 95 and 100 gamma while the F marker ranged from 98 to 105 cps. The distinction of\n@ this slight difference was crucial to follow formation and maximizing zone exposure. Like\nmarker C, the silty sandstone of marker F showed \u00e9race to spotty oil stain.\n. |\nGeo-Steering\nThe target zone within the Middle Bakken is defined as the 14\u00b0 zone below gamma marker \u2018\n\u201cMBKMGR\u2122 (Marker A). Slawson feels that optimal hydrocarbon production can be achieved '\n| with the implementation of an aggressive production frac program regardless of position within |\nthe Middle Bakken. The target zone in the Middle Bakken was established based on the samples,\nand electric logs from nearby offset wells. Prognosis predicted 35\u00b0 of viable zone between the |\nBakken shales, the first 9\u00b0 of which is above the desired target. The Magnunr 1-36-2511 required\na lateral turn to due north which resulted in the implementation of slides purely for azimuth.\n| The initial prognosis called for a regional dip of roughly 0.12? down causing the pay zone to\ndrop ~20\u201d over the course of the two section lateral. Despite structural modeling, the majority of\nMagmum [-36-251?s lateral was up dip. SM previously drilled a parallel lateral that suggested a\nnear flat formation after an initial climb. Gamma markers from a large collection of offset data |\nshowed little to no definition within the targeted interval. An example can be seen in Figure 12\n| where over half of the target interval is shown to average between 90-100 cps. As the lateral\nprogressed, the \u201cE\u201d marker became the most recognizable and efforts were made to stay\nstructurally near the cool gamma segment to help analyze dip changes with the formation. This\nr) practice led to the majority of dip calculations being made trom the \u201cE\u2122 marker. However,\nSUNBURST\nae CONSULTING"

    "text": "steering with the E: marker could be problematic when trying to determine if the wellbore passed\nbelow or above the marker as the lateral progressed\nBefore casing could be set on the Magnum, a 400\u00b0 tangent would have to be drilled to cross the '\nhard-line of section 36. The well bore landed at a casing point of 11,5297 MD (10,808.58 FVD),\napproximately 18\u00b0 TVD into the Middle Bakken and 7\u00b0 below the \u201cMBKMGR\" marker (Marker\nA). The curve was landed within marker 1 (Figure 12). Before casing, the large bend motor had\na tendency to build on rotate, making B the first identifiable marker contacted at 11,432\" MD. '\nCalculated dip showed an aggressive 0.58\u00b0 down dip. Pushing the bit down allowed the motor to |\nreenter zone. A small area of very high porosity sandstone was observed around 10.809 TVD,\nwith drilling sometimes reaching 180 fi/hr. The ambiguous gamma coupled with the relatively\nthin section of high porosity made it impossible to track. |\nAt 13,348 MD in the lateral, gamma in the range of 75-85 eps and the introduction of packstone |\nin cuttings indicated that the bit had passed into marker \u201cE\u2122. The Lindvig /-35 showed that\nmarker \u201cE\u2122 was structurally 11\u00b0 from the top of zone. With the marker confirmed, an up dip of\n0.20 \u00b0 could be calculated. The bit dropped below E until directional slides began to turn the bit\nback up to zone. Ihe accent began at ~13,757\u00b0 MD and reacquired the FE marker at 14.149\" MD. |\nThe reentry suggested that dip had reversed falling to 0.23\" down. Again, the cooler gamma was\naccompanied by an increase of limestone in samples.\nThe bit was allowed to climb up in section until the MWD gamma tool indicated that bit was\nentering the upper half of zone. As the markers D, C. and B were indistinguishable. the recent\n@ contact with marker E was utilized to determine that the encountered [25-130 cps was indicative\nof marker [. The bit leveled off and slowly fell through zone due to an apparent up dip. Samples\nwithin the upper portion of zone showed very little variation with the exception of cementing.\nThe bit slowly passed below marker E at 14.927\" MD, suggesting that the target top was around\n10,978 TVD. The new data allowed fora dip calculation of 0.29\u00b0 up.\n|\nDespite the expected down dip, formation continued to climb, delaying reentry into zone.\nContinued directional corrections allowed the bit to pass into zone at 16.350\" MD, suggesting\nthat dip had steepened slightly to 0.32\u00b0 up. It was expected that formation would tum down so\nthe decision to stay close to marker \u201cE\u201d was made. An occasional tap of marker FE would serve\nfor dip analysis. As the bit climbed through zone no other indicators were seen. After drilling\n1,423\u00b0, the E marker was seen at 17,680\u00b0 MD. Dip had flattened to a slight 0.08\u00b0 up showing\npossible signs that formation may have rolled.\nWith the possibility of a downtum, the bit angle was kept low in effort to remain agile in the\nevent that a drop should happen rapidly, The formation indicated that dip was still climbing\nwhen the E marker came up to meet the wellbore at 18.410\" MID. The marker had climbed ~2\u00b0 in\n730\u00b0 showing dip had doubled to 0.16\u00b0 up. The bit was turned around and was pushed back into\nzone at 19.240\" MD, indicating that formation was still building despite suggested structural\nmodels. |\n\u2018The bit was allowed to drill along marker D and was encouraged to climb in order to obtain some\n@ markers that may be useful for regional mapping.

Vertical operations\nwere completed on February 15, 2012 after being delayed by an under-pressured Mission\nCanyon.\n2) Localized depletion of the Mission Canyon made vertical operations difficult; however,\nquick and effective use of LCM was eventually successful in stopping the rapid loss of\ndrilling fluid.\n3) A single Security bit drilled a 1,263\u2019 MD curve in 86.94 hours for an average drilling rate\nof 14,52 ft/hr. The overall average was decreased do to the long tangent drill that was\nrequired to cross the western hard line.\n4) Lateral hole drag was reduced with the use of an inline reamer. The ease at which the bit \\\nwas able to reach bottom while sliding should indicate a nicely groomed wellbore for\nliner insertion.\n5) The Slawson Exploration Co. Magnum_1-36-2SH_awaits completion operations to\ndetermine its ultimate production potential. 4\u201d production liner will be set to bottom to\nfacilitate an aggressive fracture stimulation program.\nRespectfully submitted,\nBrandon Hill\nC/o Sunburst Consulting, Inc.\n07 March 2012\nSUNBURST\nCONSULTING\ns eroLoey senvice"

The \napproval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than \nthe 200' setback from the north & south boundaries and 1220' setback (per Commission policy) from the east \n& west boundaries within the 1280 acre spacing unit consisting of All of Sections 25 & 36 T153N R101W.  \n \nPERMIT STIPULATIONS: LOCATION PERIMETER DIKE REQUIRED.  ALSO, IN ORDER TO \nJUSTIFY THE SPACING UNIT, THE MAGNUM 1-36-25H & MAGNUM 2-36-25H MUST BE \nDRILLED BACK TO BACK.   ALTERNATIVELY, SLAWSON MUST DRILL THE MAGNUM 1-36-\n25H IF ONLY ONE WELL IS DRILLED IN THE SPACING UNIT INITIALLY.   LASTLY, \nSLAWSON MUST CONTACT MARK BINNS AT 701-220-5989 PRIOR TO LOCATION \nCONSTRUCTION. \n \nForm 1 Changes & Hard Lines  \n  Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.  \nThe proposed directional plan is at a legal location.  The minimum legal coordinate from the well head at casing \npoint is: 405E.   Also, based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum legal coordinate from the well \nhead is: 10083N & 405E. \n \nLocation Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period) \n   Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the \napproved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report.   If circumstances require operations to \ncommence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may \nbe waived by the Director.  Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information \nnecessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other \ninformation that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the \ndrilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit. \n \nPermit Fee & Notification \n \nPayment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card.  It is requested that notification be given \nimmediately upon the spudding of the well.  This information should be relayed to the Oil & Gas Division, \nBismarck, via telephone.  The following information must be included:  Well name, legal location, permit number, \ndrilling contractor, company representative, date and time of spudding.  Office hours are 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. \nand 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is (701) 328-8020, leave a message if after hours"

However, the director \nmay require the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the \noperation of the director's office in a timely manner.  Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe \ndocument, with a certification cover page to certsurvey@nd.gov. \nSurvey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.  \n \nConfidential status \n \nYour request for confidential status of all information furnished to the Director, or his representatives, is \nhereby granted.  Such information, except production runs, shall remain confidential for six months commencing \non the date the well is spud. \n \nConfidential status notwithstanding, the Director and his representatives shall have access to all well \nrecords wherever located. Your company personnel, or any person performing work for your company shall \npermit the Director and his representatives to come upon any lease, property, well, or drilling rig operated or \ncontrolled by them, complying with all safety rules, and to inspect the records and operation of such wells and to \nhave access at all times to any and all records of wells. The Commission's field personnel periodically inspect \nproducing and drilling wells.  Any information regarding such wells shall be made available to them at any time \nupon request.  The information so obtained by the field personnel shall be maintained in strict confidence and \nshall be available only to the Commission and its staff. \n \nDrilling pit \n \nPlease be advised approval for use of a drilling reserve pit or drill cuttings pit on this site is contingent on \nsite specific conditions and special pit closure requirements may apply. \n \nSurface casing cement \n \nTail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12 \nhours, and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi \nbefore drilling the plug or initiating tests.   \n \nLogs \n \nNDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of a Cement Bond Log from which the presence of \ncement can be determined in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set and a Gamma \nRay Log must be run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore.  All logs must be submitted as \none paper copy and one digital copy in LAS (Log ASCII) format, or a format approved by the Director.  Image \nlogs that include, but are not limited to, Mud Logs, Cement Bond Logs, and Cyberlook Logs, cannot be produced \nin their entirety as LAS (Log ASCII) files.  To create a solution and establish a standard format for industry to \nfollow when submitting image logs, the Director has given approval for the operator to submit an image log as a \nTIFF (*.tif) formatted file.  The TIFF (*.tif) format will be accepted only when the log cannot be produced in its \nentirety as a LAS (Log ASCII) file format. The digital copy may be submitted on a standard CD, or attached to an \nemail sent to digitallogs@nd.gov   Thank you for your cooperation.  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nSincerely,  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nTodd L.
