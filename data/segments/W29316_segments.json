In lieu of an immediate cement \nsqueeze, approval may be granted (via Form 4 Sundry Notice) to monitor the surface-production casing \nannulus. Approval will be contingent upon the following stipulations: \n1. \nThe surface-production casing annulus must be continuously monitored with an accurate \npressure gauge, the pressure gauge must not be any higher than a 300 psi gauge. \n2. \nAll valves installed on the annulus must be exposed to the surface; burial will be allowed only in \nthe presence of an Oil and Gas Division inspector. \n3. \nAny pressure development on the annulus must be immediately reported to the Oil and Gas \nDivision \n4. \nThe PERMIAN-MINNEKAHTA FM Formation must be isolated, as directed by the Oil and Gas \nDivision, upon the abandonment of the well, remedial action may be required prior to \nabandonment if warranted by the Director. \nSince the Dakota Group is not properly isolated, OASIS PETRO NO AMER must run a frac string \nprior to performing a Hydraulic Fracture Simulation per North Dakota Administrative Code Section \n43-02-03-2 7 .1 \nIf you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact me. \nSincerely, \n4?~ \nGeologist \nrsd/ras \n600 E Boulevard Ave - Dept 405, Bismarck, North Dakota 58505-0840 Phone (701)328-8020 Fax (701)328-8022"

The primary pay \nzone extended from 12\u2019-21.5\u2019 below the top of the Middle Bakken. This pay zone was \npicked for its production potential and quality of reservoir rock. The objective was to \nsteer the well within the defined pay zone and within the legal requirements of the state. \nDirectional drilling was performed by RPM and MWD services were performed by Ryan \nDirectional Services. Matthew Lorraine and Aleks Kozakowski were the primary well \nsite geologists; providing geo-steering and mud logging from Columbine Logging, Inc. \n \nWell Information \n \n \nAPI #:  33-053-06231      \n \n \n                  Field: Baker \n \nSpud Date: 02/01/2015                                                   TD Date: 2/19/2015 \n \nSurface Location: SW SW  SEC 31, T153N, R100W, 647' FSL & 320' FWL, McKenzie \nCounty, North Dakota \n \nIntermediate Casing Point:  SW SW  SEC 31, T153N, R100W, 569.08' FSL & 898.59' \nFWL, McKenzie County, North Dakota; 11,152\u2019 MD, 10,815.50\u2019 TVD \n                                                                                                                                            \nBottom Hole Location:  SE SE SEC 32, T153N, R100W, 581.88' FSL & 331.53' FEL, \nMcKenzie County, North Dakota \n \nSurface Elevation: 2,158'                                                  KB: 2183' \n  \nCasing Shoe: 11,132\u2019 MD, 10,814.57\u2019 TVD                    Total Depth Drilled: 20440\u2019 \n \nOperator: Oasis Petroleum North America LLC             Rig: Nabors B27                             \n \nCompany man:  Nathan Weathers                                   Well-site Geologist: Matthew \nLorraine, Aleks Kozakowski \nMud logging:  Columbine Logging                                  DD: RPM \n \nMud Service:  Mi Swaco                                                   Drilling Mud: Invert, Brine  \n \nMWD: Ryan Directional Services\n\n3 \n \n \n \n \n2.0 SERVICES \n \n2.1 Well site Geology (Columbine Logging, Inc.) \n \nGeological consulting and mud logging started on 2/01/2015. Services provided included; \nmorning reports, evening reports, noon and midnight reports, sample examination, \nsample recording via pictures, production of vertical and horizontal mudlog, geo steering, \nsample collection and bagging, sample mailing and a final end of well report. \n \n2.1.1 Geosteering \n \nOur primary offset GR TVD log was the Gramma Federal 5300 41-31 13T well, located \n66\u2019 north on the same pad.  From this offset log the Middle Bakken was determined to be \napproximately 34\u2019 feet thick.  Within the Middle Bakken, the primary objective was to \nstay within an 9.3\u2019 thick target window within the Middle Bakken \u201cB\u201d unit, which \nextended from 7\u2019 to 21.3\u2019 below the top of the Middle Bakken.  The target window was \nbetween 12\u2019 and 21.3\u2019 below the top of the Middle Bakken.  Gamma patterns were \ncompared with the offset log and a TVD log was created while landing the curve to in \norder to land in the targeted zone.  Steering in the lateral was accomplished by calculating \ndip from relevant gamma markers, as well as by using lithology, total gas and ROP to \ndetermine our position within the formation. \n \n2.1.2 Gamma and Surveys \n \nGamma and survey MWD services were provided by Ryan Directional Services.  The \nupper 7\u2019 of the Middle Bakken, referred to as the \u201cC\u201d unit, consisted of overall low \ngamma compared to the \u201cB\u201d and \u201cA\u201d units.  The lowest gamma readings of 80 api were \njust below the Upper Bakken Shale.  The base of the \u201cC\u201d was marked by a gamma peak \nof approximately 120 api.  \nThe \u201cB\u201d unit extended from 7\u2019 to 21.3\u2019 below the upper shale. The upper portion of the \n\u201cB\u201d consisted of three gamma peaks of varying intensity and thickness, and the lower ten \nfeet had relatively lower gamma, with some inconsistent spikes and lows.  The peaks in \nthe upper portion of the \u201cB\u201d had a maximum value of 145 api, and the lows in the lower \nportion were as low as 65 api.   \nThe \u201cA\u201d unit was expected to extend from 21.3\u2019 to 34\u2019 below the upper shale, based on \nan offset Three Forks well on the same pad.  The 12B wellbore never dropped into the \n\u201cA\u201d, but based on offset data the gamma was expected to be relatively high, and steady.  \nThe base of the \u201cA\u201d had a thin clean section of gamma, followed by the Lower Bakken \nShale.  After landing the curve, the wellbore was drilled almost entirely within the \u201cB\u201d \nunit.\n\n4 \n \n2.2 Mud Logging (Columbine Logging, Inc.) \n \n2.2.1 Sample Examination \n \nSamples were collected every 30 ft in the straight hole and build section, and every 30 ft \nwhile drilling the lateral. Descriptions included; mineralogy, color, firmness, argillaceous \ncontent, structure, texture, allochems, porosity, oil stain, and hydrocarbon fluorescence. \nCarbonate identification was determined with 10% dilute HCl-, alizarin red and \ncalcimeter. Hydrocarbon fluorescence was determined using a fluoroscope with a UV \nlamp.   \n \n \n2.2.2 Gas Detection \n \nGas was logged using a Bloodhound total gas/chromatograph system. The gas detection \nsystem uses an infra-red detector to measure total gas and the chromatograph separates \nand measures gases C1, C2, C3, iC4 and nC4. Gas was recorded in units where 1 unit \nequals 100 ppm. The gas detection system measured gases: C1, C2, C3, IC4, NC4, H2S, \nO2 and CO2.  \n \nThe Bloodhound Gas Detection and Chromatograph system use digital signal processing \ntechniques and non-dispersive infrared and chemical sensors for gas detection.  The \nsystem uses a proprietary chromatograph, which has the capability to detect from 0 to \n10,000 gas units.  This translates as 0 to 100% typical naturally-occurring hydrocarbon \ngas mixtures.  Calibration is performed using National Institute of Standards and \nTechnology (NIST) traceable calibration gases.  Lab calibration points include 0%, 2.5%, \nand 100% pure methane.  Complete immunity to saturation or damage in the presence of \nhigh concentrations of both light and heavy hydrocarbon gases precludes the necessity of \nconstant re-calibration or zero referencing. This allows the Bloodhound to react to \nhydrocarbon based gases from zero to 100% in concentration without dilution. \n \nLag time was approximated from a calculation of annular velocity based on: pump \noutput, open-hole diameter, cased hole diameter, collar diameter, drill pipe diameter and \nbottom hole assembly. Connection gases were monitored to confirm lag time calculations \nand thereby adjust lag time when needed.\n\n5 \n \n \n \n3.0 GEOLOGY \n \n3.1 Formation Tops Formation tops were picked using ROP, lithology, and gamma ray to identify \nmarkers in the curve and lateral (Table 3.1). \n \nFORMATION TOPS \nFormation/Marker \nBeds \nACTUAL \nPrognosis \nVertical Section \nTop MD (ft) \nTop TVD (ft) \nTHICKNESS \nH/L TO PROG \nTVD KB/DF(ft)\nTVDSS \n(ft) \nKibbey Lime \n8,463\u2019 \n8,462.32\u2019 \n156.99\u2019 \n3.32\u2019 low \n8,459 \n(6,276)\nCharles Salt \n8,620\u2019 \n8,619.31\u2019 \n588.99\u2019 \n8.31\u2019 low \n8,611 \n(6,428)\nUB \n9,209\u2019 \n9,208.30\u2019 \n71\u2019 \n4.7\u2019 high \n9,213 \n(7,030)\nBase Last Salt \n9,280\u2019 \n9,279.30\u2019 \n35\u2019 \n3.3\u2019 low \n9,276 \n(7,093)\nRatcliffe \n9,315\u2019 \n9,314.30\u2019 \n178\u2019 \n1.3\u2019 low \n9,313 \n(7,130)\nMission Canyon \n9,493\u2019 \n9,492.3\u2019 \n543.98\u2019 \n2.3\u2019 low \n9,490 \n(7,307)\nLodgepole \n10,037\u2019 \n10,036.28\u2019\n734.49\u2019 \n7.28\u2019 low \n10,029 \n(7,846)\nFalse Bakken \n10,916\u2019 \n10,770.77\u2019\n9.73\u2019 \n3.77\u2019 low \n10,767 \n(8,584)\nUpper Bakken Shale \n10,942\u2019 \n10,780.50\u2019\n16.62\u2019 \n2.5\u2019 low \n10,778 \n(8,595)\nMiddle Bakken \n10,999\u2019 \n10,797.12\u2019\n \n0.12\u2019 low \n10,797 \n(8,614)\n \n  \nTable 3.1 Gramma Federal 5300 41-31 12B Formation Tops \n \n3.2 Lithology \nSample analysis began at 8,200\u2019 MD in the Otter Formation.

The oil-based mud contributed a background gas of 100-150 \nunits, and saturated cuttings with oil, making all cuttings in the vertical show the same \ncut and fluorescence.  Within the lateral, Gas shows increased as the lateral progressed.  \nThe beginning of the lateral had shows of 800-2000 units, which steadily increased to \npeaks of 4800 units at connections, with a background of 4000 units. The gas buster was \nbrought online at 18820\u2019, and reduced gas readings by about 2000 units.  Flares were \nintermittent at 3\u2019 to 20\u2019.  The sandy transitional zone in the upper 2 feet of the \u201cB\u201d unit \nhad slightly higher gas readings.  \n \n3.5 Oil Shows \nInvert mud was used in the vertical, masking any oil shows. In the lateral part of the well \nthe oil shows were described as: Frequent-abundant dull to bright yellow-green \nflorescence with a moderate to flash streaming-diffuse bright blue cut fluorescence and a \nmedium brown residue ring. The best oil shows were within the top 2\u2019 of the Middle \nBakken \u201cB\u201d unit. \n \n3.6 Gas Shows \nGas logged while drilling the lateral is shown in Figure 3.6.\n\n8 \n \n4.0 WELL HISTORY \nA summary of the daily progress of the well is listed below (Table 4.0). \n \n24 HR.

The projected bottom hole \nlocation is: SE SE SEC 32, T153N, R100W, 581.88' FSL & 331.53' FEL, McKenzie \nCounty, North Dakota, with aprojected TVD of 10,881.77\u2019. \n \nThe targeted pay zone for the wellbore was a window within the Middle Bakken \u201cB\u201d \nunit, and bounded above and below by lower gamma zones.  This window extended from \n12\u2019 to 21.5\u2019 below the top of the Middle Bakken. The anticipated dip of the formation \nwas 0.6 degrees down overall, with a possibly dip reversal structure between 15000\u2019 MD \nand 17000\u2019 MD.  Anticipated dip was based on a subsurface structure map provided by \nOasis Petroleum, and nearby laterals. Our primary offset GR TVD log was from the \nGramma Federal 5300 41-31 13T, located on the same pad, 66\u2019 to the north. From this \noffset log the Middle Bakken was determined to be approximately 34\u2019 feet thick \n \nThe formation had an average dip of 89.58 degrees.  The anticipated dip reversal was not \nencountered, but we did see a flattening to 89.9 degrees between 16150\u2019 and 16600\u2019.  Gas \nreadings and oil shows were best in the upper 2\u2019-3\u2019 of the Middle Bakken \u201cB\u201d.   \n \nCurrently the well is awaiting completion. \n \n________________________________________________________________________ \n \n \nMatthew Lorraine, Aleks Kozakowski, Well-Site Geologists \nColumbine Logging, Inc. \n9844 Titan Ct.

If circumstances require operations to \ncommence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may \nbe waived by the Director.  Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information \nnecessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other \ninformation that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the \ndrilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit.\n\nLauri M. Stanfield \nSeptember 3, 2014 \nPage 2 \n \nPermit Fee & Notification \n   Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card .The permit fee has been received.  It is requested \nthat notification be given immediately upon the spudding of the well.  This information should be relayed to the \nOil & Gas Division, Bismarck, via telephone.  The following information must be included:  Well name, legal \nlocation, permit number, drilling contractor, company representative, date and time of spudding.  Office hours are \n8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is (701) 328-8020, leave a \nmessage if after hours or on the weekend.  \n \nSurvey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells \n   NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey contractor \nshall file a certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion.  Surveys \nmust be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director may \nrequire the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the \noperation of the director's office in a timely manner.  Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe \ndocument, with a certification cover page to certsurvey@nd.gov.    \nSurvey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.  \nSpecifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve \n(or when sliding) and 90 feet in the lateral. \n \nSurface casing cement \n \nTail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12 \nhours, and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi \nbefore drilling the plug or initiating tests.   \n \nLogs \n \nNDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of (1) a suite of open hole logs from which formation tops and \nporosity zones can be determined, (2) a Gamma Ray Log run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore, and \n(3) a log from which the presence and quality of cement can be determined (Standard CBL or Ultrasonic cement evaluation \nlog) in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set, this log must be run prior to completing the well.  \nAll logs run must be submitted free of charge, as one digital TIFF (tagged image file format) copy and one digital LAS (log \nASCII) formatted copy. Digital logs may be submitted on a standard CD, DVD, or attached to an email sent to \ndigitallogs@nd.gov \n   \nThank you for your cooperation.  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nSincerely,

The Commission is very \nconcerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry. \n \nEffective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the \nwell is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations \nare conducted.  The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an \nauthorized facility.
