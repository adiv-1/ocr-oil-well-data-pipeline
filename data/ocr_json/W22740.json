Larry 5301 44-12B [SE SE Sec. 12, T153N \nR101W] is located approximately 8 miles south and 2 miles west of the town of Williston \nin McKenzie County, North Dakota. The Larry 5301 44-12B is a horizontal Middle \nBakken development well in part of Oasis Petroleum\u2019s Baker prospect within the \nWilliston Basin. The vertical hole was planned to be drilled to approximately 10,246\u2019. \nThe curve would be built at 12 degrees per 100\u2019 to land within the Middle Bakken. This \nwell is a three section horizontal lateral which originates in the southeast quarter of \nSection 12, then drilled south to land in northeast quarter of Section 13. The well bore \nwas steered south to the southeast of Section 25. (Figure 2) Directional drilling \ntechnologies were used to land in the Middle Bakken Member reservoir and maintain \nexposure to the target."

The formation thicknesses expressed by gamma signatures in these \nwells, and the Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC Kline 5300 11-18H [Lot 1 Section \n18, T153N, R100W] were used to assist in landing the curve. This was accomplished by \ncomparing gamma signatures from the offset wells to gamma data collected during \ndrilling operations. The casing target landing true vertical depth (TVD) was periodically \nupdated to ensure accurate landing of the curve. Data used in this evaluation are found in \nthis report."

This \ninformation network provided depth, drilling rate, pump strokes and total gas units to \nmultiple areas throughout the well site. Gas data was fed from Sunburst\u2019s digital gas \ndetector, a total gas chromatograph, through Rig-watch for dissemination. Hydrocarbon \nconstituents (C1 through C4) were recorded in part-per-million concentrations. Gas \nsampling was pulled through \u00bc\u201d polyflo tubing after agitation in Sunburst\u2019s gas trap at \nthe shakers. Rig crews caught lagged samples at the direction of the well site geologists. \nSamples were collected at 30\u2019 intervals in the vertical/curve and 30\u2019 intervals in the \nlateral. Rock cuttings were analyzed in wet and dry conditions under a 10x45 power \nbinocular microscope (for detailed lithologic descriptions see appendix). Cuttings were \nsent to North Dakota Geologic Survey. In addition to rock samples, rate of penetration \nand gamma ray data were also used in geologic analysis to aid geo-steering and dip \ncalculations.  \n \nLithology \n \nFormation analysis began at 8,170\u2019 MD with a red orange siltstone and anhydrite \ncharacteristic of the Kibbey Formation [Mississippian Big Snowy Group].

This marker is \nrepresented by an anhydrite, which was off white. It was soft, amorphous, with an earthy \ntexture, and a trace of sand grains. The anhydrite is often accompanied by slower \npenetration rates as the bit transitions out of the overlying siltstone. The rate of \npenetration (ROP) then increases as the bit exits the anhydrite into the underlying \nlimestone mudstone. This carbonate was described as a light gray to gray lime mudstone \nwhich was microcrystalline or occasionally laminated with an earthy texture. Samples in \nthe lower section consisted of red to red orange siltstone that was friable with an earthy \ntexture. This facies was moderately to well cemented with calcite and also was \ninterbedded with soft, off white amorphous or cryptocrystalline anhydrite.  \n \nThe Charles Formation [Mississippian Madison Group] consisted of salt, anhydrite, \nlimestone and argillaceous lime mudstone. The first Charles salt was drilled at 8,502' MD \n(-6,419') SS. The Base of the Last Salt (BLS) was logged at 9,199' MD 9,198' TVD (-\n7,115') SS as indicated by slower penetration rates and increased weight on bit. The \nintervals of salt within the Charles Formation can be identified by an increase in \npenetration rates and lower API gamma count rates. Samples of the salt intervals were \ndescribed as clear to milky, crystalline, euhedral to subhedral, and hard, with no visible \nporosity. Slower penetration rates are observed as the bit encounters sections of limestone \nmudstone to wackestone, which was light gray to light gray brown, light brown, \nmicrocrystalline, friable, and dense, with an earthy texture. This limestone was \nargillaceous in part in areas where gamma API counts were elevated. In areas where the \npenetration rates were slowest anhydrite was observed. These samples were described as \noff white to white, soft with cryptocrystalline texture or amorphous. Within the Charles \nFormation at 9,086\u2019 MD slower penetration rates indicated the presence of anhydrite. \nThis section was approximately 24\u2019 thick, its base, as indicated by the transition to faster \npenetration rates and higher gamma API counts is indicative of the Upper Berentson \nwhich was drilled at 9,111' MD 9,110' TVD (-7,027') SS. \n \nThe Ratcliffe interval [Charles Formation] was drilled at 9,231' MD 9,230' TVD (-7,147') \nSS.

Drilling would proceed with these values \nuntil the API counts dropped to what were considered normal values, then the driller \nwould pick up and re-log the erroneous gamma ray data. These distances ranged from 10\u2019 \nto 60\u2019. The gamma API counts from approximately 17,700\u2019 MD to TD, also appeared to \nshift lower by approximately 10 to 15 API units, making it difficult to correlate with \ngamma previously seen in the lateral.  \n \nDrilling out of intermediate casing the early inclinations were above 90 degrees. Offset \nlogs and information provided by Oasis representatives indicated that the well bore was \nto follow a downward path during the early portion of the lateral, which led onsite \npersonnel to steer the well bore down to a position in the lower portion of the preferred \ndrilling zone, where it remained for the greater portion of the lateral. The assembly while \ndrilling in the lower portion of the target interval, began oscillating between two tight \nstreaks located above and below it. Gamma values that ranged from the mid forties to the \nmid thirties, along with the presence of limestone in collected samples indicated that the \nwell bore had encountered the overlying limestone member. Gamma values in the mid \nthirties to low forties indicated without the presence of limestone that the well bore had \nencountered the hard streak below it, a well-cemented silty sandstone. Between these \ntight streaks the gamma counts ranged form the mid forties to the mid sixties. As noted \nearlier, from approximately 17,700\u2019 MD to TD, these values shifted 10 to 15 API counts \nlower.  \n \nAs the well bore drilled to the south, the overlying limestone member appeared to thin, \nuntil it was no longer logged with gamma or observed in drill cuttings. The well bore \nthen moved up to the upper portion of the preferred drilling zone, and even above it. The \nwell bore, while above the target interval persistent to rise on rotation, and continued to \ndeflect off of a tight streak located below it. It became necessary to institute many down \nside slides to keep the well bore from striking the overlying upper Bakken shale.  \n \nTotal depth (TD) of 20,464\u2019 MD was reached at 1550 hours CDT August 3, 2012.

    "text": "SUMMARY  \n \nThe Larry 5301 44-12B is a successful well in Oasis Petroleum\u2019s horizontal Middle Bakken \ndevelopment program. The project was drilled from surface to TD in 19 days. The TD of \n21,140\u2019 MD was achieved at 1550 hours CDT August 3, 2012. The well site team worked \nwell together maintaining the well bore in the desired target interval for 92% of the \nlateral, opening 9,812\u2019 of potentially productive reservoir rock \n \nDiesel invert drilling fluid 9.6-9.9 ppg for the vertical hole and 9.9-10.3 ppg for curve \noperations were used to maintain stable hole conditions, minimize washout through the salt \nintervals and permit adequate analysis of mud gas concentrations.  \n \nSamples in the Middle Bakken were generally silty sandstone which was varying shades \nof gray, off white to white, tan, very fine grained silty sandstone consisting of moderately \nsorted, subangular quartz grains. Additionally this facies was moderately calcite \ncemented; with a trace of disseminated and nodular pyrite. Poor intergranular porosity \nwas observed, as was a trace of light brown spotty oil stain. Also present in varying \namounts was a light brown to brown, translucent, with a trace of off white sandstone. \nThis sandstone was fine to very fine grained, friable, with subangular to subround quartz \ngrains which were moderately sorted, and calcite cemented. Also present was a trace of \ndisseminated and nodular pyrite. It had from fair to poor intergranular porosity, with even \nand spotty light brown oil stain.  \n \nGas monitoring and fluid gains provided evidence of a hydrocarbon saturated reservoir \nduring the drilling of the Larry 5301 44-12B. Oil and gas shows at the shakers and in \nsamples were continuously monitored. In the closed mud system, hydrostatic conditions \nwere maintained near balance. This allowed for gas and fluid gains from the well to be \nmonitored. Gas on the Larry 5301 44-12B varied according to penetration rates and \nlocation of the well bore in the stratigraphic column. Observed concentrations ranged \nfrom 3,000 to 4,000 units background gas, and connection peaks of 6,000 to 8,000 units \nin earlier portion of the lateral where shows were the best. In the later portion of the \nlateral flow was diverted through the gas buster, effectively muting recordable gas values. \nThere were no trips during the drilling of the lateral therefore no trip gases were noted. \n \nThe Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC. Larry 5301 44-12B awaits completion operations to \ndetermine its ultimate production potential. \n \n \n \nRespectfully submitted,  \nZA jt\u00e7\u00c7x cx\u00e0x\u00dc\u00e1\u00c9\u00c7 \nc/o Sunburst Consulting, Inc.  \n6 August, 2012"

The approval is \ngranted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than the 200' setback from the \nnorth & south boundaries and 500' setback from the east & west boundaries within the 1280 acre spacing unit consisting of \nSections 13 & 24 T153N, R101W.  \n \nPERMIT STIPULATIONS: DUE TO SURFICIAL WATER ADJACENT TO THE WELL SITE, A DIKE IS \nREQUIRED SURROUNDING THE ENTIRE LOCATION.  In cases where a spacing unit is accessed from an \noff-site drill pad, an affidavit must be provided affirming that the surface owner of the multi-well pad agrees to \naccept burial on their property of the cuttings generated from drilling the well(s) into an offsite spacing/drilling \nunit.  Tool error is not required pursuant to order. OASIS PETRO. NO. AMER. must contact NDIC Field \nInspector Marc Binns at 701-220-5989 prior to location construction.   \n \nDrilling pit \nNDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that \u201ca pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well drilling and \ncompletion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will prevent pollution of \nthe land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits are prohibited. All pits shall be \ninspected by an authorized representative of the director prior to lining and use.  Drill cuttings and solids must be stabilized \nin a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings pit.\u201d \n \nForm 1 Changes & Hard Lines  \n  Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.  The \nproposed directional plan is at a legal location.  The minimum legal coordinate from the well head at casing point is: 450\u2019 \nsouth.   Also, based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum legal coordinates from the well head are: 10570\u2019 \nsouth and 300\u2019 east. \n \nLocation Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period) \n   Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the approved \ndrilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report.   If circumstances require operations to commence before the 3rd \nbusiness day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may be waived by the Director.  \nApplication for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information necessary to evaluate the extenuating \ncircumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other information that would allow the Director to \nconclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the drilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit. \n \nPermit Fee & Notification \n   Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card .The permit fee has been received.  It is requested that \nnotification be given immediately upon the spudding of the well.  This information should be relayed to the Oil & Gas \nDivision, Bismarck, via telephone.  The following information must be included:  Well name, legal location, permit number, \ndrilling contractor, company representative, date and time of spudding.  Office hours are 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 \np.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is (701) 328-8020, leave a message if after hours or on the weekend."

    "text": "Kaitlin Bass \nApril 11, 2012 \nPage 2 \n \nSurvey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells \n   NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey contractor shall file a \ncertified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion.  Surveys must be submitted as \none electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director may require the directional survey to be \nfiled immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the operation of the director's office in a timely manner.  \nCertified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe document, with a certification cover page to certsurvey@nd.gov.    \nSurvey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.  \nSpecifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve (or when \nsliding) and 90 feet in the lateral. \n \nSurface casing cement \n \nTail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12 hours, and tail \ncement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi before drilling the plug or \ninitiating tests.   \n \nLogs \n \nNDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of a Cement Bond Log from which the presence of cement can be \ndetermined in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set and a Gamma Ray Log must be run from \ntotal depth to ground level elevation of the well bore.  All logs must be submitted as one paper copy and one digital copy in \nLAS (Log ASCII) format, or a format approved by the Director.  Image logs that include, but are not limited to, Mud Logs, \nCement Bond Logs, and Cyberlook Logs, cannot be produced in their entirety as LAS (Log ASCII) files.  To create a \nsolution and establish a standard format for industry to follow when submitting image logs, the Director has given approval \nfor the operator to submit an image log as a TIFF (*.tif) formatted file.  The TIFF (*.tif) format will be accepted only when \nthe log cannot be produced in its entirety as a LAS (Log ASCII) file format. The digital copy may be submitted on a 3.5\u201d \nfloppy diskette, a standard CD, or attached to an email sent to digitallogs@nd.gov \n   \nThank you for your cooperation.  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nSincerely,  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nNathaniel Erbele  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nPetroleum Resource Specialist"
