(Continental) filed with the North Dakota Industrial Commission \u2014\nOil and Gas Division (Commission) on March 9, 2018 an application for a Stripper Well\nDetermination for the above captioned well.\nInformation contained in the application indicates that the above mentioned well is a stripper\nwell pursuant to statute and rule, and Continental has elected to designate said well as a stripper\nwell. The well produced from a well depth greater than 10000 fect and was completed after June\n30, 2013. During the qualifying period, October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2017, the well\nproduced at a maximum efficient rate or was not capable of exceeding the production threshold.\nThe average daily production from the well was 32.0 barrels of oil per day during this period.\nIt is therefore determined that the above captioned well qualifies as a \u201cStripper Well\u201d pursuant to\nSection 57-51.1-01 of the North Dakota Century Code. This determination is applicable only 10\nthe Bakken Pool in and under said well.\nThe Commission shall have continuing jurisdiction, and shall have the authority to review the\nmatter, and to amend or rescind the determination if such action is supported by additional or\nnewly discovered information. If you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact me.\nSincerely,\nDavid J. McCusker\nPetroleum Engineer\nCe: ND Tax Department"

Cyclone 4 spud \nthe Tallahassee 3-16H Well on November 8th, 2013 from its surface hole location of 2585' FNL \n& 268' FEL Section 16, Township 153N, Range 101W. \n \nThe surface was pre-drilled with 9 inch surface casing set at 1975' MD. From there the 8 3/4\" \nvertical portion was drilled to 10064' MD where the motor had failed. After TOOH for the curve \nassembly, the well bore rotated to the kick off point of 10137' MD. LEAM provided Directional \nDrilling as well as the Measurement While Drilling (MWD) services during the entire course of \nthe Well. NorAm Wellsite Services provided both Mud Logging and Geosteering Services.  \n \nThe curve portion of the Tallahassee 3-16H well bore began on November 12, 2013 5:30 hrs at a \nkick off point of 10137' MD. The three forks member was intercepted at 10748' MD, 10571' \nTVD, (-8583SS) and final landing point of 10863' MD, 10586' TVD placed the bit 15' into \nformation. The curve was completed in roughly 34.5 hrs ending at 10863' MD, 10586' TVD on \nNovember 13th, 2013 16:03 hrs. \n \nThe Lateral portion of the Tallahassee 3-16H well bore began at 1:57hrs on November 16, 2013 \nafter intermediate 7 inch casing was set at 10829' MD. The Tallahassee 3-16H reached it's total \ndepth (TD) of 18434' MD, 10573.62' TVD on November 21, 2013 at 18:35 hours. The entire \nlateral portion of the Tallahassee 3-16H well bore was completed in roughly 136.5 hrs with an \noverall dip of 90.1 degrees. Tallahassee 3-16H bottom hole location is 232' FSL & 1304' FEL \nSection 21, T153N, R101W.

The approval is granted on \nthe condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than the 200' setback from the north & south \nboundaries and 500' setback from the east & west boundaries within the 2560 acre spacing unit consisting of Sections 4, 9, 16, & 21-\nT153N-R101W. Tool error is not required pursuant to order. \n \n \nPERMIT STIPULATIONS: The mouse and rat hole must be cemented.  A liner must be placed under the location.  A spill \ncontingency plan must be in place prior to spudding the wells.  No Drilling Pit will be allowed.  Due to surficial water adjacent \nto the well site, a dike is required surrounding the entire location.  One horizontal well shall be drilled and completed in the \nstandup 1280-acre spacing unit decribed as Sections 4 and 9, T153N-R101W, McKenzie County, north Dakota, prior to \ncompleting any horizontal well in the 2560-acre spacing unit described as Sections 4, 9, 16, and 21-T153N-R101W McKenzie \nCounty, North Dakota.  Continental must drill the Columbus Federal 2-16H, 3-16H and Tallahassee 2-16H, 3-16H back to back.  \nCONTINENTAL RESOURCES must contact NDIC Field Inspector Richard Dunn at 701-770-3554 prior to location \nconstruction.   \n \nDrilling pit \nNDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that \u201ca pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well drilling and completion \noperations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will prevent pollution of the land surface and \nfreshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits are prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized \nrepresentative of the director prior to lining and use.  Drill cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director \nprior to placement in a cuttings pit.\u201d \n \nForm 1 Changes & Hard Lines  \n  Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.  The proposed directional \nplan is at a legal location.  The minimum legal coordinate from the well head at casing point is: 232\u2019 W.   Also, based on the azimuth of the \nproposed lateral the maximum legal coordinate from the well head is: 7751\u2019 S and a minimum legal coordinate from the well head of 232\u2019 \nW. \n \nLocation Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period) \n   Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the approved drilling permit \non the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report.   If circumstances require operations to commence before the 3rd business day following \npublication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may be waived by the Director.  Application for a waiver must be by sworn \naffidavit providing the information necessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and \nany other information that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the drilling permit, \nthe applicant should retain the permit. \n \nPermit Fee & Notification \n \nPayment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card.  It is requested that notification be given immediately upon the \nspudding of the well.  This information should be relayed to the Oil & Gas Division, Bismarck, via telephone.  The following information \nmust be included:  Well name, legal location, permit number, drilling contractor, company representative, date and time of spudding.  \nOffice hours are 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is (701) 328-8020, leave a \nmessage if after hours or on the weekend.\n\nTerry L. Olson \nMarch 11, 2013 \nPage 2 \n \n   Survey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells \n \nNDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey contractor shall file a certified \ncopy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion.  Surveys must be submitted as one electronic copy, or \nin a form approved by the director. However, the director may require the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the \nsurvey is needed to conduct the operation of the director's office in a timely manner.  Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one \nadobe document, with a certification cover page to certsurvey@nd.gov. \nSurvey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.  \nSpecifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve (or when sliding) and 90 \nfeet in the lateral. \n \nConfidential status \n \nYour request for confidential status of all information furnished to the Director, or his representatives, is hereby granted.  Such \ninformation, except production runs, shall remain confidential for six months commencing on the date the well is spud. \n \nConfidential status notwithstanding, the Director and his representatives shall have access to all well records wherever located. \nYour company personnel, or any person performing work for your company shall permit the Director and his representatives to come \nupon any lease, property, well, or drilling rig operated or controlled by them, complying with all safety rules, and to inspect the records and \noperation of such wells and to have access at all times to any and all records of wells. The Commission's field personnel periodically inspect \nproducing and drilling wells.  Any information regarding such wells shall be made available to them at any time upon request.  The \ninformation so obtained by the field personnel shall be maintained in strict confidence and shall be available only to the Commission and \nits staff. \n \nSurface casing cement \n \nTail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12 hours, and tail cement \nutilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi before drilling the plug or initiating tests.   \n \nLogs \n \nNDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of (1) a suite of open hole logs from which formation tops and porosity zones \ncan be determined, (2) a Gamma Ray Log run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore, and (3) a log from which the \npresence and quality of cement can be determined (Standard CBL or Ultrasonic cement evaluation log) in every well in which production \nor intermediate casing has been set, this log must be run prior to completing the well.

If the downgraded API burst pressure is below our minimum required frac pressures, we \nwill run a 4-1/2\u201d frac string; if severe wear or holes are found in the casing, we will run a 5\u201d \ncemented, to surface, tie back string.   \nThe CBL log is run in order to determine the top of cement, as required by the NDIC. \nOur current 4-1/2\u201d liner program for a 1280 unit is 30, evenly spaced, stages with 29 swellable \npackers.  The liner shoe is set approximately 180 feet off bottom.  The shoe stage below the last \npacker has 2 joints, a double valved float, one joint, and a ported guide shoe \u2013 appx 130 ft.  The \nliner is run using a running tool on the end of 4\u201d DP.  The 7\u201d packer/hanger is set about 40 ft \nabove KOP between two casing collars but conditions occasionally occur that require setting \nhigher, either through unexpected failure or in order to isolate casing wear close to KOP.  \nRecently we have tried 40 stage liners and the trend to explore the optimum stage count will \ncontinue..  Once the liner is at depth, a ball is dropped through the DP, the ball is pressured up \nagainst the setting tool to approximately 2500 psi, and the 7\u201d packer/hanger is set. \nA push pull test is done to confirm the hanger has set.  Then, a 4500 psi pressure test is \ncompleted on the back side of the 4\u201d DP to confirm the packer has set.  The setting tool is then \nbacked off and the 4\u201d DP/running tool is laid down. \nImmediately after the rotary rig has been moved off the well location, the 7\u201d csg and liner \npacker/ hanger are tested to the frac pressure.  The testers will rig up and test the tubing head to \n5000 psi.  Next a test plug will be run and set, using wire line, in the top of the 7\u201d packer/hanger.  \nTesters will pressure up to our frac pressure, typically 8500 psi, to confirm the 7\u201d is ready for \ncompletion.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nShawn Svob \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDrilling Operations Coordinator\n\n=A uuTuin|\nvununcimar ncasuulece SITE DETAILS 1 Agimuths to True Nosh a west(-easi(t) [OUUTHIN\nField: McKenzie County, ND Tallahassee 3 mM Magnetic North: 8.65 4 1500 Ct) 4800\nSite: Tallahassee 3 Sec. 46 - TI53N R-101W : renee\nWell: 3-16H SHL 2585\u00b0 FNL & 268' FEL.

The ditectional wellbore lies\napproximately 660\u00b0 FEL of See. 4, T1S3N, R101 W, terminating at a BHL 769\u201d N. of SHL, 2094? FSL\nof Sec. 4, T153N, RIOIW. Botlom hole TVD of the existing directional well is 13451\u2019, The deepest\ncasing string is 8-5/8\u201d set at a depth of 3035\u201d TVD.\nThe proposed Columbus Federal 3-16H is a horizontal well targeting the Middle Bakken formation.\nSurface hole location for the Columbus Federal 3-16H is 2469\u201d FSL and 199\u00b0 FEL, of Sec. 16, TIS3N,\nRIOIW. The majority of the Columbus Federal 3-16H lateral will lie 760\u00b0 FEL in order to avoid the\nexisting Mildred 1 wellbore by approximately 100\u00b0. The lateral will taper back to 660\u00b0 FEL, at 10155\u201d\nN. of SHL, after adequately clearing the segment of the Mildred 1 wellbore within this Baker-Bakken\npool.\nThe Baker-Bakken pool, as defined by NDIC Order No. 21551, is the interval from 50 feet above the top\nof the Bakken Formation to above the top of the Birdbear Formation. CRI has assessed the geology of\nthe area and has determined this Bakken interval to be approximately 10461? TVD to 10,771\" TVD. On\nthe surface planar, the Mildred 1 wellbore exist in this interval for approximately 38\u00b0, from 1874\u201d FST.\nto 1912\u2019 FSL of Sec. 4, TIS3N, ROAW.\nThe completion of the Columbus Federal 3-16H will protect the integrity of the Mildred 1 wellbore.\nStimulation plans will be made to include a buffer zone with swell packers of a minimum 500\u00b0 from\neither side of the Mildred 1 wellbore existing within the Baker-Bakken pool. This zone will not be\nperforated or completed,\nCRI believes adequate precautions have been taken to prevent the possibility of a wellbore collision and\naccepts all responsibility should such a collision occur.\nSarah Madden, PD Engineer\nContinental Resaurecs.

The storage tanks on site store petroleum based drilling mud,\ndiesel fuel, the invert tanks being the base for the drilling mud, salt water tanks,\nfresh water tanks, crude oil storage tanks and empty tanks for emergency\nstorage. in addition to the storage tanks, other operations that can produce\ncontaminants are the drilling operation itself and the cuttings drying operation. It\nis the purpose of this plan to define the prevention containment and\ncountermeasure plan for discharges from any of these sources on the site. All\nthe actions taken in this regard are per approved policies of this part of 40 CFR\n112. Universally and in setting up the drilling operation on the site prevention\nmeasures are taken by grading the site to contain discharges, building in\neffective valves and other related operational and control mechanisms to prevent\ndischarges. This equipment is installed and tested prior to beginning drilling\noperations. The tanks and equipment are installed within secondary containment\nberms and containment trenches and sumps are installed around the facilities\nprior to beginning drilling operations with capacity to contain with freeboard a\nrupture of the largest vessel associated with the containment. In the event of a\ndischarge the sites are equipped with vacuums that are capable of picking up the\nspilled material and loading it into containers where it can be transferred to an\napproved disposal location. In the event of a discharge larger than can be\nhandled by Cyclone and other manpower on location or that leaks offsite and\npotentially into navigable waters of the US, the operator, under his directions will\narrange for trained contract personnel to immediately contain and clean-up the\ndischarge.\n112.7(a)(2} This plan will comply with all applicable items of this part. With\nno deviations anticipated.\n412.7(a)(3} The attached sketch shows a typical layout of the drill rig sites\ndepicting the location, size and contents of the tanks. There are no\nunderground tanks nor are there any mobile or portable containers\nassociated with these drilling locations. The site is prepared in advance of\nthe drill rig coming onto the site. The sites are designed and constructed to\ncontain spills and tank ruptures on the site. The drill rig and associated tanks\nand equipment are laid out in an efficient and effective manner to streamline the\ndrilling operation. Frack tanks are located in such a manner that they have easy\naccess to the mud tanks with valves located on both ends of transfer lines. The\ndrilling mud tanks are plumbed to the drill rig with valves appropriately located to\nPage 1 of 6\n\nstop flow from the tanks to the rig or from the rig to the tanks. The cuttings from\nthe drilling operation are screened from the recycled drilling mud and directed to\na container were they are dried using fly ash or some other equally effective\nabsorbent material and are then transferred to the lined cuttings disposal pit\nonsite. The fuel tank is tied into the fuel lines providing fuel flow to the\ngenerators. Blowout preventers are placed over the drill hole casing and tested\nprior to beginning the drilling.\n112.7(aX3)i) The type of oil in each fixed container and its storage\ncapacity.

When the rig is moved onto the site and set up additional discharge\nprevention and containment measures are taken. Equipment inspection records\n\nPage 2 of 6\n\nare reviewed and the equipment is inspected following written procedures, the\nwritten procedures are attached in the appendix of the plan. A dated record of the\ninspection, signed by the appropriate supervisor or inspector is recorded and\nfiled with time sheets or safety meeting minutes, when the drill tig changes\nlocations and notes of deficiencies or acceptance are included. Operation and\nmaintenance of equipment is designed to prevent discharges. Personnel are\ntrained and made aware of the discharge prevention procedures and applicable\npollution control laws, rules and regulations. The tool pusher in charge of the drill\nsig will have in his possession a copy of the Cyclone Drilling SPCC Plan and it is\nhis responsibility to instruct the employees and make them aware of the\ndischarge prevention measures contained in the plan. Scheduled briefings and\ntefreshers are to be conducted with all the employees prior to and during rig up\noperations, such briefings are to be held during regularly scheduled safety\nmeetings.\n\nEmployees are assigned to make routine inspections of valves, hose connections\nand other fluid connections for leaks. These inspections are made and\ndocumented on a monthly basis at a minimum. These leaks are provided drip\npans and reported to the appropriate personnel for repair. If repairs cannot be\nreadily made then regular emptying of the drip pans is required until the repairs\ncan be made. Inspections of trenches and sumps are made on a regular basis to\ninsure that they are free flowing and functional. The containment berms are also\ninspected periodically to insure their stability and function.\n\n112.7(a)(3)(iii) Discharge or drainage controls such as secondary\ncontainment around containers and other structures, equipment, and\nprocedures for the control of the discharge; Containment berms are placed\naround the tanks containing crude oil, the invert dritling fluid, salt water tanks and\nthe empty tanks to be used for emergency storage, as secondary containment.\nThe containment berms are of adequate height to contain a rupture and total\nfailure of the largest tank contained within it amounting to 400 BBLS requiring a\ncontainment capacity of 3,000 cu. ft. Similarly, berms are built around the crude\noil storage tanks on the site and requiring the same containment volume. Berms\nor trenches and sumps are constructed around the drill rig itself, the drilling mud\ntanks and diesel fuel tank, the sumps and trenches are sized to contain the\nvolume of the largest tank in the case of a rupture and complete failure.\nAdditionally, drip pans are placed under leaking valves, hose joints and other\nsources of smail leaks until the item can be replaced or repaired to not leak.\nRegular inspections of these facilities are made to insure that they will function\nper plan.\n\n112.7(a)(3)(iv) Countermeasures for discharge discovery, response, and\ncleanup (both the facility's capability and those that might be required of a\ncontractor); Regular inspections may reveal a discharge such as a leaking\nvalve or hose joint. These instances can readily be cleaned up by employees of\nCyclone Orilling using on site vacuums and containers. Larger spills up to and\n\nPage 3 of 6\n\nbeyond the reporting limits can also be handled by Cyclone Drilling employees.\nSpills that exceed the limitations of the onsite cleanup equipment or in the event\nof a spill migrating offsite, will require the tool pushers\u2019 notification of the\noperator/owner of the site and they will contact the clean-up contractor thay have\ncontracted with to contain and clean-up such events.\n412.7(a)(3)(v) Methods of disposal of recovered materials in accordance\nwith applicable legal requirements: When spills occur the fluids will be either\nsoaked up with absorptive material and placed in a container for transporting to\nan approved disposal site or vacuumed up and placed in a storage container for\ntransportation to an approved disposal site. It is understood by ait Cyclone\nDrilling employees that there is not an approved disposal site on or around the\ndrilling rig to dispose of these recovered materials or fluids, other than drying\ndrilling cuttings and disposing of them in the cuttings pit.\n112.7(a)(3)(vi) Contact list and phone numbers for the facility response\ncoordinator, National Response Center, cleanup contractors with whom\noperator has an agreement for response, and all appropriate Federal, State,\nand local agencies who must be contacted in the event of a discharge as\ndescribed in \u00a7 112.1(b). Facility Response Coordinator for Cyclone Drilling\nHSE Dept. (Ph. 307-682-4161) is responsible for contacting the operators\nenvironmental group so they can contact the appropriate Federal, State and\nLocal personnel in the event of a discharge as described in \u00a7 112.1(b).\n112.7(a)(4) Information and procedures to enable a person reporting a\ndischarge as described in \u00a7 112.1(b) to relate information on the exact\naddress or location and phone number of the facility; the date and time of\nthe discharge, the type of material discharged; estimates of the total\nquantity discharged; estimates of the quantity discharged as described in\n\u00a7 112.1(b); the source of the discharge: a description of all affected media;\nthe cause of the discharge; any damages or injuries caused by the\ndischarge; actions being used to stop, remove, and mitigate the effects of\nthe discharge; whether an evacuation may be needed; and, the names of\nindividuals and/or organizations who have also been contacted. In the\nevent of a discharge as described in \u00a7112.1(b) it is the responsibility of the tool\npusher to relate the above information to the operators environmental group so\nthey can contact, any emergency organizations and provide the reporting\nnecessary to the Federal, State and Local agencies that require reporting of such\na discharge. The tool pusher on the rig is the person in charge and either he or\nthe drilling superintendent have the responsibility of reporting the answers to the\nabove questions. These questions are spelled out on a \u201cDischarge Reporting\nForm\u201d that each has at his disposal in the appendix of \u201cCyclone Drilling Oil Spill\nContingency Plan\u201d In reporting a discharge a list of all individuals and or\norganizations that received the report will be listed.\n\nPage 4 of 6\n\n112.7(a)(5) Plan procedures to be used when a discharge occurs:\n\n1) Immediately extinguish any heater or fire that may ignite the spill.\n\n2) No smoking during spill control operations.\n\n3) Close all associated valves.\n\n4) Direct discharge to ditches or drains that will carry the discharge to a safe\nholding sump or reserve pit.\n\n5) Distribute hill, fibertex, gel, barite, or any other absorptive material available\nas required to contain the discharge not entering the ditch, sump or reserve\npit.\n\n6) Inspect area to ensure that all of the discharge is contained in ditches, sumps\nor reserve pits. Add ditches or diversion structures as required to contain the\ndischarge onsite.\n\n7) Start jet or sump pumps and transfer discharged material from sumps to\nreserve pit or holding tanks.\n\n8) After discharge is stopped, collect all used hulls, fibertex and similar\nabsorptive material for disposal per instruction from the drilling superintendent\nor the tool pusher. No ail is to remain in the ditches or sumps that may create\na fire hazard.\n\n9) Hold collected discharged material for hauling and disposal in an approved\nlocation.\n\n10) If discharge migrates from the drill rig location Cyclone Drilling personnet will\nuse these same procedures stop and recover the discharge. Additionally the\ntool pusher will notify the owners representative to notify the contract clean-\nup company for clean-up and mitigation of the offsite discharge migration.\n\n11) Fill out Site Discharge Reporting Form and distribute to appropriate agencies\nand personnel. (Form included in Appendix of Plan)\n\n112.7(a)(5)(b) Flow diagram of potential discharges from significant\n\nsources as a result of facilities failure: Flow diagrams and quantities\n\nincluded in appendix of the plan.\n\n112.7(a\\(5\\(c) Site discharge containment system: The site discharge\n\ncontainment system for the Cyclone Drilling Rigs is a combination of containment\n\nberms, confinement trenches, sumps and reserve pits. Drip pans will be used for\nsmall discharges until repairs are make or equipment replaced. (See typical site\nplan included in appendix.)\n\n112.7(a)(5)(d)_ Not applicable as all measures spelled out in this part are\n\npractical as describe in each section.\n\n112.7(a)(5)(e) Inspections, tests and records: Written procedures are\n\nprovided on the \u201cDischarge Source Inspection Record\", these inspections are\n\nrecorded at least on a monthly basis or whenever a leak or discharge is detected\nand reported, using the \u201cDischarge Source Inspection Record\u201d in the appendix.\n\nThese records are signed by the tool pusher onsite and maintained by Cyclone\n\nDrilling for a period of 3 years.\n\nPage 5 of 6\n\n112.7(a)(5}(f} Personnel Training and Discharge Prevention Procedures:\nThe personnel working on the drilling crews are trained in the maintenance and\noperation of all the equipment to prevent discharges, the discharge procedures\nand generai facility operations. They are also made aware of the contents of the\nSPCC Plan. The tool pusher on each crew is the person on the locatian who is\naccountable for discharge prevention and who reports to the Cyclone Drilling\nManagement. The tool pusher is responsible for conducting discharge\nprevention briefings and assuring an adequate understanding of the Cyclone\nDrilling SPCC Plan for the facility and any recent developments of new\nprecautionary measures due to fallures or malfunctions are implemented.\n112.7(a)(5)(g) Site Security: All persons entering the site are required to check\nin with the tool pusher of the on duty crew. Unauthorized persons are not\nallowed on the site. Unauthorized visitors are easily detected, questioned\nregarding there presents and appropriately escorted to take care of their\nbusiness.\n112.7(a)(5)(h) Facility Tank Truck Leading/Unloading: The tank truck\nloading and unloading areas on the Cyclone Drilling Sites are located adjacent to\nthe frack tank or crude oil tank batteries the area adjacent to the tank battery,\nwhere tank trucks are loaded and unloaded will be graded to drain info the\ncontainment trenches and associated sump, surrounding the drill rig, mud tanks,\nfuel tank, ete. Wheel chocks are used to prevent the truck from moving while\nconnected to the tanks during loading/unloading operations. Before departure\nthe vehicle is inspected for leaks in the lowermost drains and outlets and if they\nare any detected the associated valves are tightened or adjusted to prevent\ndischarge while in transit. All above ground containers are checked and\nevaluated for risk of discharge or failure and as necessary appropriate action\nshall be taken.\n\nPage 6 of 6\n\nd\nEg OL ek Ces\nJune 12, 2012\nIndustrial Commission of North Dakota\nOil & Gas Division\n600 East Boulevard, Dept 405\nBismarck, North Dakota 58505\nRe: Tallahassce 3-16H\nContinental Resources, Inc., would like to request all filings and information regarding the above\ncaptioned well be considered \u201cTight Hole\u201d.\nPlease charge the Continental Resources, Inc., credit card that is on file with your agency for the\napplication fee of this well.\nThank you for your prompt attention to this matter.
