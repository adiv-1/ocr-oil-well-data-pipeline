The Foley Federal 5307 43-/24/ is a horizontal Middle Bakken well within the\nWilliston Basin consisting of one ~9,425\u2019 long lateral drilled towards the north (360\u00b0). The\nvertical hole was drilled to a depth of 10,257\u2019 measured depth (MD). Plans called for a\n12\u00b0/100\" built rate in the curve to ensure landing within the Middie Bakken silty sandstone.\nTo isolate the targeted reservoir and meet legal requirements, intermediate casing was set '\nafter drilling to 11.915\u2019 MD (Figure 2), After intermediate casing had been set, directional\ndrilling and geo-steering techniques were employed to maintain maximum exposure to the\nlarget TeServolr.\nCONSULTING\na ee \u2014. \u2014 \u2014__Weceacocy service"

MWD gamma\ntay data was utilized during the curve build and lateral sections. During both the vertical and\ncurve-build sections, tops were compared to primary offset wells to ensure successful landing\nwithin the target zone. The true vertical depth (TVD) of the landing target was calculated by\nassuming comparable formation thicknesses to the closest offset wells, the Bray 530/ 43-\nFH and Lindvig 1-1/HR.

After two\nUpper Bakken Shale strikes from wild bounces near the top of the zone and the tendency of\nthe mud motor to build heavily in rotation our target interval dropped to 13\u201d below the Upper\nBakken Shale.

County\nWildcat Dakota McKenzie\nA Gi\nDETAILS OF WORK\nOasis requests permission for suspension of drilling for up to 90 days for the referenced well under NDAC 43-02-03-\n55. Oasis intends to drill the surface hole with freshwater based drilling mud and set surface casing with a small\ndrilling rig and move off within 3 to 5 days. The casing will be set at a depth pre-approved by the NDIC per the\nApplication for Permit to Drill NDAC 43-02-03-21. No saltwater will be used in the drilling and cementing operations of\nthe surface casing. Once the surface casing is cemented, a plug or mechanical seal will be placed at the top of the\ncasing to prevent any foreign matter from getting into the well. A rig capable of drilling to TD will move onto the\nlocation within the 90 days previously outlined to complete the drilling and casing plan as per the APD. The\nundersigned states that this request for suspension of drilling operations in accordance with the Subsection 4 of\nSection 43-02-03-55 of the NDAC, is being requested to take advantage of the cost savings and time savings of using\nan initial rig that is smaller than the rig necessary to drill a well to total depth but is not intended to alter or extend the '\nterms and conditions of, or suspend any obligation under, any oil and gas lease with acreage in or under the spacing\nor drilling unit for the above-referenced wall. Oasis understands NDAC 43-02-03-31 requirements regarding\nconfidentiality pertaining to this permit. The lined reserve pit will be fenced immediately after construction if the well\npad is located in a pasture (NDAC 43-02-03-19 & 19.1). Oasis will plug and abandon the well and reclaim the well site if\nthe well is not drilled by the larger rotary rig within 90 days after spudding the well with the smaller drilling rig. .\nCompany \u2018Telephone Number\nOasis Petroleum North America LLC 281.404.9488 FOR STATE USE ONLY\nAddress.\n{001 Fannin, Suit 1500\nCity State Zip Code Date\nrom [Tid\nL\no fA Laura Strong ra Th Gd 9\nDrilling Engineer May 11, 2014 Title\nEmail Address Mincral Regources Permit Manager\nLetrong@oasispetroleum.com"

All logs must be submitted as \none paper copy and one digital copy in LAS (Log ASCII) format, or a format approved by the Director.  Image \nlogs that include, but are not limited to, Mud Logs, Cement Bond Logs, and Cyberlook Logs, cannot be produced \nin their entirety as LAS (Log ASCII) files.  To create a solution and establish a standard format for industry to \nfollow when submitting image logs, the Director has given approval for the operator to submit an image log as a \nTIFF (*.tif) formatted file.  The TIFF (*.tif) format will be accepted only when the log cannot be produced in its \nentirety as a LAS (Log ASCII) file format. The digital copy may be submitted on a 3.5\u201d floppy diskette, a standard \nCD, or attached to an email sent to digitallogs@nd.gov    \nThank you for your cooperation.  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nSincerely,  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nNathaniel Erbele  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nPetroleum Resource Specialist"
