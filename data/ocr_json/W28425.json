Services provided \nincluded; morning reports, evening reports, noon and midnight reports, sample \nexamination, sample recording via pictures, production of vertical and horizontal mudlog, \ngeo steering, sample collection and bagging, sample mailing and a final end of well \nreport. \n \n2.1.1 Geosteering \n \nOur offset GR TVD logs were from the Wade Federal 5300 41-30 9B well, located on the \nsame well pad as Wade Federal 5300 41-30 6B. Within the Middle Bakken, the primary \nobjective was to stay near the middle gamma markers which marks the inter layering \nbetween dolomitic siltstone and limy sandstones. Gamma patterns were compared with \nthe offset log and a TVD log was created while landing the curve to in order to land in \nthe targeted zone.  Steering in the lateral was accomplished by calculating dip from \nrelevant gamma markers, as well as by using lithology, total gas and ROP to determine \nour position within the formation. \n \nThis well contained two Upper Bakken shale strikes leading to two sidetracks (please \nrefer to Figure 4.1). The first shale strike was at 13,500\u2019 MD; 10,721\u2019 TVD and the \nsecond at approximately 15,100\u2019 MD; 10736\u2019 TVD.  \n \n2.1.2 Gamma and Surveys \n \nGamma and survey MWD services were provided by Schlumberger/Pathfinder.  The \nmajority of the well was drilled within the target area of the Middle Bakken.   \n \n2.2 Mud Logging (Columbine Logging, Inc.) \n \n2.2.1 Sample Examination \n \nSamples were collected every 30 ft in the straight hole and build section, and every 30 ft \nwhile drilling the lateral. Descriptions included; mineralogy, color, firmness, argillaceous \ncontent, structure, texture, allochems, porosity, oil stain, and hydrocarbon fluorescence. \nCarbonate identification was determined with 10% dilute HCl-, alizarin red and \ncalcimeter. Hydrocarbon fluorescence was determined using a fluoroscope with a UV \nlamp."

    "text": "2.2.2 Gas Detection \n \nGas was logged using a Bloodhound total gas/chromatograph system. The gas detection \nsystem uses an infra-red detector to measure total gas and the chromatograph separates \nand measures gases C1, C2, C3, iC4 and nC4. Gas was recorded in units where 1 unit \nequals 100 ppm. The gas detection system measured gases: C1, C2, C3, IC4, NC4, H2S, \nO2 and CO2.  \n \nThe Bloodhound Gas Detection and Chromatograph system use digital signal processing \ntechniques and non-dispersive infrared and chemical sensors for gas detection.  The \nsystem uses a proprietary chromatograph, which has the capability to detect from 0 to \n10,000 gas units.  This translates as 0 to 100% typical naturally-occurring hydrocarbon \ngas mixtures.  Calibration is performed using National Institute of Standards and \nTechnology (NIST) traceable calibration gases.  Lab calibration points include 0%, 2.5%, \nand 100% pure methane.  Complete immunity to saturation or damage in the presence of \nhigh concentrations of both light and heavy hydrocarbon gases precludes the necessity of \nconstant re-calibration or zero referencing. This allows the Bloodhound to react to \nhydrocarbon based gases from zero to 100% in concentration without dilution. \n \nLag time was approximated from a calculation of annular velocity based on: pump \noutput, open-hole diameter, cased hole diameter, collar diameter, drill pipe diameter and \nbottom hole assembly. Connection gases were monitored to confirm lag time calculations \nand thereby adjust lag time when needed. \n \n3.0 GEOLOGY \n \n3.1 Formation Tops Formation tops were picked using ROP, lithology, and gamma ray to identify markers in the \ncurve and lateral (Table 3.1).  \nFORMATION TOPS \nFormation/Marker Beds \nACTUAL \nPrognosis \nVertical Section \nTop MD (ft) \nTop TVD (ft) \nTHICKNESS (ft) \nDifference (ft) \nTVD KB/DF(ft) \nTVDSS \n(ft) \nKibbey Lime \n8348 \n8347 \n144 \n0 \n8347 \n-6277 \nCharles Salt \n8492 \n8491 \n685 \n-1 \n8490 \n-6420 \nBase Last Salt \n9177 \n9176 \n215 \n0 \n9176 \n-7106 \nMission Canyon \n9392 \n9391 \n543 \n1 \n9392 \n-7322 \nLodgepole \n9935 \n9934 \n736 \n0 \n9934 \n-7864 \nFalse Bakken \n10768 \n10670 \n9 \n-11 \n10659 \n-8589 \nUpper Bakken Shale \n10786 \n10679 \n17 \n-4 \n10675 \n-8605 \nMiddle Bakken \n10827 \n10696 \n12 \n-3 \n10693 \n-8623 \nMiddle Bakken Top of Target \n10827 \n10708 \n13 \n-3 \n10705 \n-8635 \nMiddle Bakken Base of Target \n10827 \n10721 \n16 \n-3 \n10718 \n-8648 \nLower Bakken Shale \n10827 \n10737 \n  \n-3 \n10734 \n-8664"

Due to drainage adjacent to the well site, a dike is required surrounding the \nentire location.  OASIS PETROLEUM NORTH AMERICA LLC must take into consideration NDAC 43-02-03-28 (Safety \nRegulation) when contemplating simultaneous operations on the above captioned location.  Pursuant to NDAC 43-02-03-28 \n(Safety Regulation) \u201cNo boiler, portable electric lighting generator, or treater shall be placed nearer than 150 feet to any \nproducing well or oil tank.\u201d  Oasis may set conductor on permitted wells only.  OASIS PETRO NO AMER must contact NDIC \nField Inspector Richard Dunn at 701-770-3554 prior to location construction. \n \nDrilling pit \nNDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that \u201ca pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well drilling and completion \noperations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will prevent pollution of the land surface and \nfreshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits are prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized \nrepresentative of the director prior to lining and use.  Drill cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director \nprior to placement in a cuttings pit.\u201d \n \nForm 1 Changes & Hard Lines  \n  Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.  The proposed directional \nplan is at a legal location.  Based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum legal coordinate from the well head is: 10042\u2019E. \n \nLocation Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period) \n   Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the approved drilling permit \non the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report.   If circumstances require operations to commence before the 3rd business day following \npublication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may be waived by the Director.  Application for a waiver must be by sworn \naffidavit providing the information necessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and \nany other information that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the drilling permit, \nthe applicant should retain the permit. \n \nPermit Fee & Notification \n   Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card .The permit fee has been received.  It is requested that notification be given \nimmediately upon the spudding of the well.  This information should be relayed to the Oil & Gas Division, Bismarck, via telephone.  The \nfollowing information must be included:  Well name, legal location, permit number, drilling contractor, company representative, date and \ntime of spudding.  Office hours are 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is (701) 328-\n8020, leave a message if after hours or on the weekend."
