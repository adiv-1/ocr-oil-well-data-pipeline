Nabors B22 drilling the Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC - Chalmers 5300 21-19 9B,  \nFebruary, 2015 in Baker Field, McKenzie County, North Dakota. \n \nINTRODUCTION  \n \nThe Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC Chalmers 5300 21-19 9B [Lot 2 Section 19, \nT153N, R100W] is located approximately 7 miles south of the town of Williston in McKenzie \nCounty, North Dakota. The Chalmers 5300 21-19 9B is a horizontal Middle Bakken well within \nthe Williston Basin consisting of one 9,369' (uncased) lateral drilled toward the east. The vertical \nhole was planned to be drilled to approximately 10,230\u2019. The curve would be built at 12 degrees \nper 100\u2019 to land within the Middle Bakken. This well is a two section lateral which originates in \nthe northwest quarter of section 19, then drilled east to the northeast quarter of section 20. \nDirectional drilling technologies and geosteering techniques were used to land in the Middle \nBakken reservoir and maintain exposure to the ideal target rock.\n\nOFFSET WELLS  \nOffset well data used for depth correlation during curve operations are found in the \u2018Control \nData\u2019 section appended to this report. Offset well control was essential in curve operations, to \nsuccessfully land within the Middle Bakken. Formation thicknesses expressed by gamma ray \nsignatures in these wells were compared to gamma data collected during drilling operations in \norder to successfully land the curve. The target landing true vertical depth (TVD) was \nperiodically updated during drilling to ensure accurate landing of the curve.  \n \nGEOLOGY \n \nThe Charles Formation [Mississippian Madison Group] was logged 8,535' MD 8,535' TVD        \n(-6,459' SS). Samples in the lower portion of the Charles Formation consisted of a limestone \nmudstone, which was light brown, light gray brown, light gray brown, off white in color. It was \nmicrocrystalline, friable, laminated, with an earthy texture. A trace of intercrystalline porosity \nwas observed as was occasional to rare spotty light brown oil stain. Occasionally noted was a \ndolomite mudstone, which was light brown, light gray, light gray brown in color. It was \nmicrocrystalline, friable-firm, laminated, with an earthy texture. Also noted was a trace of \nintercrystalline porosity, and occasional spotty light brown oil stain. Rarely noted was anhydrite, \nwhich was off white, cream in color. It was soft, microcrystalline, and massive with an earthy to \namorphous texture. Following connections or periods of non-circulation, gas peaks of 40 to 42 \nunits were noted, as were drilling gas shows of 31 to 40 units.   \n \nThe Mission Canyon Formation [Mississippian Madison Group] was logged 9,435' MD 9,435' \nTVD (-7,359' SS). The Mission Canyon Formation consisted of a lime mudstone that was \ndescribed as light gray, light brown to brown, gray brown, trace dark gray in color. The lime \nmudstone was predominately friable to firm, with an earthy to rarely crystalline in texture. Some \nintervals contained a trace of black-brown algal material, a trace of fossil fragments, and traces \nof disseminated pyrite. Also present was an argillaceous lime mudstone that was described as \nlight gray, occasional medium gray, rare gray tan, rare off white, trace dark gray in color. The \nargillaceous lime mudstone was predominately firm to friable, crystalline to chalky texture. \nSome intervals contained a trace of disseminated pyrite. Gas shows of 33 to 64 units were \npresent. Rare intercrystalline porosity was noted as well as traces to occasional spotty light \nbrown oil stain was occasionally observed while logging the Mission Canyon Formation. \n \nThe Upper Bakken Shale [Mississippian-Bakken Formation] was drilled at 10,888' MD 10,727' \nTVD (-8,651' SS). Entry into this member was characterized by high gamma, elevated \nbackground gas and increased rates of penetration. The black to black gray carbonaceous and \npetroliferous shale was hard with a sub blocky to sub platy texture. Fracture porosity was noted, \nand trace minerals were observed to include disseminated pyrite and calcite fracture fill. \nHydrocarbons evaluated in this interval reached a maximum of 2,365 units drilling gas, with a \nconnection gas of 2,803 units.\n\nFigure 2. Black carbonaceous and petroliferous shale from the Upper Bakken Shale. \n \nThe Middle Bakken [Mississippian-Devonian Bakken Formation] was reached at 10,958' MD \n10,743' TVD (-8,667' SS) which was 4\u2019 low to the Oasis Petroleum NA LLC Chalmers 5300 21-\n19 8T. The target zone of the Middle Bakken was to be drilled in a predominately ten foot zone \nbeginning ten feet below the Upper Bakken Shale.  \n                                       \nSamples in the Middle Bakken were predominantly silty sandstone which was described as light-\nmedium brown, occasional light gray brown, rare light gray in color. It was very fine grained, \nfirm-friable, sub rounded to sub angular, smooth, moderately sorted, calcite cement moderately \ncemented. A trace of disseminated and nodular pyrite was noted as was occasional intergranular \nporosity. Also noted was common light to medium brown spotty to even oil stain.  \n \nFigure 3.  Predominately silty sandstone sample from the Middle Bakken target zone. \n \nHydrocarbon Shows  \n \nGas monitoring and fluid gains provided evidence of a hydrocarbon saturated reservoir during \nthe drilling of the Chalmers 5300 21-19 9B. Oil and gas shows at the shakers and in samples \nwere continuously monitored. In the closed mud system, hydrostatic conditions were maintained \nnear balance, this allowed for gas and fluid gains from the well to be evaluated. Gas on the \nChalmers 5300 21-19 9B varied according to stratigraphic position and penetration rates which \nmay have reflected increased porosity. During the vertical, gas peaks of 35 to 64 units were\n\nnoted, against a 10.1-11.4 lb/gal diesel-invert mud \nweight. Background concentrations in the lateral ranged \nfrom 1,000 to 5,100 units, against a 9.65-10.2 lb/gal \nsaltwater gel drilling fluid. Connection peaks of 2,000 to \n4,500 units were observed, as were drilling gas shows of \n2,500 units to 5,736 units coinciding with the best \nshows. Drilling out of casing at 11,127\u2019 MD yielded a \ntrip gas of 4,875 units. At 12,600\u2019 the gas buster was \nturned on, resulting in 5\u2019-10\u2019 intermittent flare and a \n20\u2019-25\u2019 large bright orange trip flair at 14,878\u2019. \nChromatography of gas revealed typical concentrations \nof methane, characteristic of Middle Bakken Member \ngas.   \n \n \n \n \nFigure 4.

Profile displaying total gas, gamma ray and rate of penetration.\n\nGeosteering \n \nRyan Energy Technologies provided personnel and equipment for measurement-while-drilling \n(MWD) services. The RPM directional drillers and MWD, and Sunburst Consulting personnel \nworked closely together throughout the project to evaluate data and make steering decisions to \nmaximize the amount of borehole in the targeted zones and increase rate of penetration (ROP) of \nthe formation.  \n \nThe 904\u2019 curve was drilled in 24 hours. It was drilled with a bottom hole assembly (BHA) \nconsisting of bit #3, a Security MMD55M PDC bit, attached to a 2.38 degree fixed NOV stage \n7/8 5.0 motor and MWD tools. The curve was successfully landed at 11,127\u2019 MD and 10,758\u2019 \nTVD, approximately 15\u2019 into the Middle Bakken. Seven inch diameter 32# HCP-110 casing was \nset to 11,071\u2019 MD.  \n \nGeologic structure maps of the Chalmers 5300 21-19 9B and surrounding control wells had \nestimated formation dip to be a down dip at approximately 0.5\u00ba down to the TD of the lateral. \nThe preferred drilling interval of the Chalmers 5300 21-19 9B consisted of a ten foot zone \nlocated approximately ten feet into the Middle Bakken. Penetration rates, gas shows, gamma ray \ndata, and sample observations were utilized to keep the wellbore in the preferred stratigraphic \nposition in the target zone. Using offset well data provided by Oasis representatives, projected \nporosity zones were identified in the preferred drilling areas.  \n \n \n \nFigure 6.  Offset well target definition, Indian Hills Prospect (Oasis).   \n \nSteering decisions were made by using gamma markers identified by Oasis representatives. The \nhigh gamma (C) in the upper portion of the drilling zone was useful in identifying the well bore \nplacement in formation. The slightly lower gamma (B) was observed as the well bore moved to \nthe top of the target zone, followed by lower gamma as the well bore moved higher, out of the \ntarget zone. Low gamma in the middle of the target zone (D) was noted as the well bore moved \nto the middle of the target zone. As the well bore moved lower in formation, the higher gamma \n(E) was noted as was lower gamma as the well bore moved lower in formation, exiting the target \nzone. Samples collected when drilling below the target zone tended to have a greater \nconcentration of the light gray to gray silty sandstone than did the samples collected when the \nwell bore was higher in the target zone. The TD of 20,440\u2019 MD was achieved at 16:40 hours\n\nCST February 26, 2015. The well site team worked together to maintain the well bore in the \ndesired target interval for 77% of the lateral, opening 9,369\u2019 of potentially productive reservoir \nrock. The hole was then circulated and reamed for completion. \n \nSUMMARY  \n \nThe Chalmers 5300 21-19 9B is a successful well in Oasis Petroleum\u2019s horizontal Middle \nBakken development program in Baker Field. The project was drilled from surface casing to TD \nin 20 days. The TD of 20,440\u2019 MD was achieved at 16:40 hours CST February 26, 2015. The \nwell site team worked together to maintain the well bore in the desired target interval for 77% of \nthe lateral, opening 9,369\u2019 of potentially productive reservoir rock.  \n \nSamples in the Middle Bakken were predominantly silty sandstone which was described as light-\nmedium brown, occasional light gray brown, rare light gray in color. It was very fine grained, \nfirm-friable, sub rounded to sub angular, smooth, moderately sorted, calcite cement moderately \ncemented. A trace of disseminated and nodular pyrite was noted as was occasional intergranular \nporosity. Also noted was common light to medium brown spotty to even oil stain.  \n \nGas on the Chalmers 5300 21-19 9B varied according to stratigraphic position and penetration \nrates which may have reflected increased porosity. The overall gas and hydrocarbon shows were \nencouraging and indicate a hydrocarbon rich system in the Middle Bakken. \n \nThe Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC. Chalmers 5300 21-19 9B awaits completion \noperations to determine its ultimate production potential.  \n \nRespectfully submitted,  \n \nG. Wayne Peterson \nMichelle R.

The \napproval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than \nthe 500' setback from the north & south boundaries and 200' setback from the east & west boundaries within the \n1280 acre spacing unit consisting of Sections 19 &20 T153N R100W.  \n \nPERMIT STIPULATIONS: Due to the proximity of Lake Sakakawea to the well site, a dike is required \nsurrounding the entire location. Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for \nfilter sock disposal must be maintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, and must \nremain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations are \nconducted. OASIS PETRO NO AMER must contact NDIC Field Inspector Richard Dunn at 701-7703-\n554 prior to location construction. \n \nDrilling pit \nNDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that \u201ca pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well \ndrilling and completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will \nprevent pollution of the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits \nare prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized representative of the director prior to lining and use.  \nDrill cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings \npit.\u201d \n \nForm 1 Changes & Hard Lines  \n  Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.  \nThe proposed directional plan is at a legal location.  Based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum \nlegal coordinate from the well head is: 9963\u2019 east. \n \nLocation Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period) \n   Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the \napproved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report.   If circumstances require operations to \ncommence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may \nbe waived by the Director.  Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information \nnecessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other \ninformation that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the \ndrilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit.\n\nBrandi Terry \nJune 17, 2014 \nPage 2 \n \n \nPermit Fee & Notification \n   Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card .The permit fee has been received.  It is requested \nthat notification be given immediately upon the spudding of the well.  This information should be relayed to the \nOil & Gas Division, Bismarck, via telephone.  The following information must be included:  Well name, legal \nlocation, permit number, drilling contractor, company representative, date and time of spudding.  Office hours are \n8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is (701) 328-8020, leave a \nmessage if after hours or on the weekend.  \n \nSurvey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells \n   NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey contractor \nshall file a certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion.  Surveys \nmust be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director may \nrequire the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the \noperation of the director's office in a timely manner.  Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe \ndocument, with a certification cover page to certsurvey@nd.gov.    \nSurvey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.  \nSpecifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve \n(or when sliding) and 90 feet in the lateral. \n \nSurface casing cement \n \nTail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12 \nhours, and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi \nbefore drilling the plug or initiating tests.   \n \nLogs \n \nNDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of (1) a suite of open hole logs from which formation tops and \nporosity zones can be determined, (2) a Gamma Ray Log run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore, and \n(3) a log from which the presence and quality of cement can be determined (Standard CBL or Ultrasonic cement evaluation \nlog) in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set, this log must be run prior to completing the well.  \nAll logs run must be submitted free of charge, as one digital TIFF (tagged image file format) copy and one digital LAS (log \nASCII) formatted copy. Digital logs may be submitted on a standard CD, DVD, or attached to an email sent to \ndigitallogs@nd.gov \n   \nThank you for your cooperation.  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nSincerely,

\nRE:  Filter Socks and Other Filter Media \n \n \n \n \nLeakproof Container Required \n \n \n \n \nOil and Gas Wells \n \nDear Operator, \n \nNorth Dakota Administrative Code Section 43-02-03-19.2 states in part that all waste material associated with \nexploration or production of oil and  gas must be properly disposed of in an authorized facility in accord with all \napplicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations. \n \nFiltration systems are commonly used during oil and gas operations in North Dakota.  The Commission is very \nconcerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry. \n \nEffective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the \nwell is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations \nare conducted.  The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an \nauthorized facility.  Such containers must be: \n\uf0b7 \nleakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container \n\uf0b7 \ncovered to prevent precipitation from entering the container \n\uf0b7 \nplacard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container \n \nIf the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but \nonly upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request. \n \nAs previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01 \nstates in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production \nwastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste \nManagement.
