(Continental) filed with the North Dakota Industrial Commission \u2014\nOil and Gas Division (Commission) on March 9, 2018 an application for a Stripper Well\nDetermination for the above captioned well.\nInformation contained in the application indicates that the above mentioned well is a stripper\nwell pursuant to statute and rule, and Continental has elected to designate said well as a stripper\nwell. The well produced from a well depth greater than 10000 fect and was completed after June\n30, 2013. During the qualifying period, October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2017, the well\nproduced at a maximum efficient rate or was not capable of exceeding the production threshold.\nThe average daily production from the well was 32.0 barrels of oil per day during this period.\nIt is therefore determined that the above captioned well qualifies as a \u201cStripper Well\u201d pursuant to\nSection 57-51.1-01 of the North Dakota Century Code. This determination is applicable only 10\nthe Bakken Pool in and under said well.\nThe Commission shall have continuing jurisdiction, and shall have the authority to review the\nmatter, and to amend or rescind the determination if such action is supported by additional or\nnewly discovered information.

Cyclone 4 spud \nthe Tallahassee 3-16H Well on November 8th, 2013 from its surface hole location of 2585' FNL \n& 268' FEL Section 16, Township 153N, Range 101W. \n \nThe surface was pre-drilled with 9 inch surface casing set at 1975' MD. From there the 8 3/4\" \nvertical portion was drilled to 10064' MD where the motor had failed. After TOOH for the curve \nassembly, the well bore rotated to the kick off point of 10137' MD. LEAM provided Directional \nDrilling as well as the Measurement While Drilling (MWD) services during the entire course of \nthe Well. NorAm Wellsite Services provided both Mud Logging and Geosteering Services.  \n \nThe curve portion of the Tallahassee 3-16H well bore began on November 12, 2013 5:30 hrs at a \nkick off point of 10137' MD. The three forks member was intercepted at 10748' MD, 10571' \nTVD, (-8583SS) and final landing point of 10863' MD, 10586' TVD placed the bit 15' into \nformation. The curve was completed in roughly 34.5 hrs ending at 10863' MD, 10586' TVD on \nNovember 13th, 2013 16:03 hrs. \n \nThe Lateral portion of the Tallahassee 3-16H well bore began at 1:57hrs on November 16, 2013 \nafter intermediate 7 inch casing was set at 10829' MD. The Tallahassee 3-16H reached it's total \ndepth (TD) of 18434' MD, 10573.62' TVD on November 21, 2013 at 18:35 hours. The entire \nlateral portion of the Tallahassee 3-16H well bore was completed in roughly 136.5 hrs with an \noverall dip of 90.1 degrees. Tallahassee 3-16H bottom hole location is 232' FSL & 1304' FEL \nSection 21, T153N, R101W. No trips were necessary in the Lateral."

Continental Resources, Inc. intends to drill the surface hole with freshwater based drilling \nmud and set surface casing with a small drilling rig and move off within 3 to 5 days. The casing wlll be set at a depth \npre-approved by the NDIC per the Application for Permit to Drill NDAC 43-02-03-21. No saltwater wlll be used In the \ndrilling and cementing operations of the surface casing. Once the surface casing is cemented, a plug or mechanical \nseal will be placed at the top of the casing to prevent any foreign matter from getting into the well. A rig capable of \ndrilling to TD wlll move onto the location within the 90 days previously outlined to complete the drllllng and casing \nplan as per the APO. The undersigned states that this request for suspension of drllllng operations In accordance \nwith the Subsection 4 of Section 43-02-03-55 of the NDAC, Is being requested to take advantage of the cost savings \nand time savings of using an initial rig that is smaller than the rig necessary to drill a well to total depth but is not \nintended to alter or extend the tenns and conditions of, or suspend any obllgatlon under, any oil and gas lease with \nacreage in or under the spacing or drilling unit for the above-referenced well. Continental Resources, Inc. \nunderstands NDAC 43-02-03-31 requirements regarding confidentiality pertaining to this permit. The drilling pit will \nbe fenced Immediately after construction if the well pad is located In a pasture (NDAC 43-02-03-19 & 19.1}. \nContinental Resources, Inc. will plug and abandon the well and reclaim the well site If the well ls not drilled by the \nlarger rotary rig within 90 days after spudding the well with the smaller drilling rig. \nAddress \nP.O.

The approval is granted on \nthe condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than the 200' setback from the north & south \nboundaries and 500' setback from the east & west boundaries within the 2560 acre spacing unit consisting of Sections 4, 9, 16, & 21-\nT153N-R101W. Tool error is not required pursuant to order. \n \n \nPERMIT STIPULATIONS: The mouse and rat hole must be cemented.  A liner must be placed under the location.  A spill \ncontingency plan must be in place prior to spudding the wells.  No Drilling Pit will be allowed.  Due to surficial water adjacent \nto the well site, a dike is required surrounding the entire location.  One horizontal well shall be drilled and completed in the \nstandup 1280-acre spacing unit decribed as Sections 4 and 9, T153N-R101W, McKenzie County, north Dakota, prior to \ncompleting any horizontal well in the 2560-acre spacing unit described as Sections 4, 9, 16, and 21-T153N-R101W McKenzie \nCounty, North Dakota.  Continental must drill the Columbus Federal 2-16H, 3-16H and Tallahassee 2-16H, 3-16H back to back.  \nCONTINENTAL RESOURCES must contact NDIC Field Inspector Richard Dunn at 701-770-3554 prior to location \nconstruction.   \n \nDrilling pit \nNDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that \u201ca pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well drilling and completion \noperations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will prevent pollution of the land surface and \nfreshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits are prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized \nrepresentative of the director prior to lining and use.  Drill cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director \nprior to placement in a cuttings pit.\u201d \n \nForm 1 Changes & Hard Lines  \n  Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.  The proposed directional \nplan is at a legal location.  The minimum legal coordinate from the well head at casing point is: 232\u2019 W.   Also, based on the azimuth of the \nproposed lateral the maximum legal coordinate from the well head is: 7751\u2019 S and a minimum legal coordinate from the well head of 232\u2019 \nW. \n \nLocation Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period) \n   Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the approved drilling permit \non the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report.   If circumstances require operations to commence before the 3rd business day following \npublication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may be waived by the Director.  Application for a waiver must be by sworn \naffidavit providing the information necessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and \nany other information that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the drilling permit, \nthe applicant should retain the permit. \n \nPermit Fee & Notification \n \nPayment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card.  It is requested that notification be given immediately upon the \nspudding of the well.  This information should be relayed to the Oil & Gas Division, Bismarck, via telephone.  The following information \nmust be included:  Well name, legal location, permit number, drilling contractor, company representative, date and time of spudding.  \nOffice hours are 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time.

Box 1032    Enid, Oklahoma 73702 \n(580) 233-8955 \nTo: \nTodd Holweger, NDIC \nFrom: Shawn Svob \nDate: \n4/5/2012 \nRe: \nContinental Resources standard CCL, CBL, 4-1/2\u201d liner running and testing procedures \n \nContinental Resources\u2019 standard practice for running the cement bond log and casing \ncaliper log is to run both logs immediately after coming out of the hole after TD, prior to running \nthe 4-1/2\u201d liner, to the deepest depth obtainable; however, if there are well control concerns that \nrequire us to run the liner sooner, only the CBL will be run and the CCL will be run after setting \nthe liner.   \nBased on the CCL results, we determine the actual API minimum burst allowance for the 7\u201d \ncasing.   If the downgraded API burst pressure is below our minimum required frac pressures, we \nwill run a 4-1/2\u201d frac string; if severe wear or holes are found in the casing, we will run a 5\u201d \ncemented, to surface, tie back string.   \nThe CBL log is run in order to determine the top of cement, as required by the NDIC. \nOur current 4-1/2\u201d liner program for a 1280 unit is 30, evenly spaced, stages with 29 swellable \npackers.  The liner shoe is set approximately 180 feet off bottom.  The shoe stage below the last \npacker has 2 joints, a double valved float, one joint, and a ported guide shoe \u2013 appx 130 ft.  The \nliner is run using a running tool on the end of 4\u201d DP.  The 7\u201d packer/hanger is set about 40 ft \nabove KOP between two casing collars but conditions occasionally occur that require setting \nhigher, either through unexpected failure or in order to isolate casing wear close to KOP.  \nRecently we have tried 40 stage liners and the trend to explore the optimum stage count will \ncontinue..  Once the liner is at depth, a ball is dropped through the DP, the ball is pressured up \nagainst the setting tool to approximately 2500 psi, and the 7\u201d packer/hanger is set. \nA push pull test is done to confirm the hanger has set.  Then, a 4500 psi pressure test is \ncompleted on the back side of the 4\u201d DP to confirm the packer has set.  The setting tool is then \nbacked off and the 4\u201d DP/running tool is laid down. \nImmediately after the rotary rig has been moved off the well location, the 7\u201d csg and liner \npacker/ hanger are tested to the frac pressure.  The testers will rig up and test the tubing head to \n5000 psi.  Next a test plug will be run and set, using wire line, in the top of the 7\u201d packer/hanger.  \nTesters will pressure up to our frac pressure, typically 8500 psi, to confirm the 7\u201d is ready for \ncompletion.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nShawn Svob \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDrilling Operations Coordinator"

Botlom hole TVD of the existing directional well is 13451\u2019, The deepest\ncasing string is 8-5/8\u201d set at a depth of 3035\u201d TVD.\nThe proposed Columbus Federal 3-16H is a horizontal well targeting the Middle Bakken formation.\nSurface hole location for the Columbus Federal 3-16H is 2469\u201d FSL and 199\u00b0 FEL, of Sec. 16, TIS3N,\nRIOIW. The majority of the Columbus Federal 3-16H lateral will lie 760\u00b0 FEL in order to avoid the\nexisting Mildred 1 wellbore by approximately 100\u00b0. The lateral will taper back to 660\u00b0 FEL, at 10155\u201d\nN. of SHL, after adequately clearing the segment of the Mildred 1 wellbore within this Baker-Bakken\npool.\nThe Baker-Bakken pool, as defined by NDIC Order No. 21551, is the interval from 50 feet above the top\nof the Bakken Formation to above the top of the Birdbear Formation. CRI has assessed the geology of\nthe area and has determined this Bakken interval to be approximately 10461? TVD to 10,771\" TVD. On\nthe surface planar, the Mildred 1 wellbore exist in this interval for approximately 38\u00b0, from 1874\u201d FST.\nto 1912\u2019 FSL of Sec. 4, TIS3N, ROAW.\nThe completion of the Columbus Federal 3-16H will protect the integrity of the Mildred 1 wellbore.\nStimulation plans will be made to include a buffer zone with swell packers of a minimum 500\u00b0 from\neither side of the Mildred 1 wellbore existing within the Baker-Bakken pool. This zone will not be\nperforated or completed,\nCRI believes adequate precautions have been taken to prevent the possibility of a wellbore collision and\naccepts all responsibility should such a collision occur.\nSarah Madden, PD Engineer\nContinental Resaurecs.

The storage tanks on site store petroleum based drilling mud,\ndiesel fuel, the invert tanks being the base for the drilling mud, salt water tanks,\nfresh water tanks, crude oil storage tanks and empty tanks for emergency\nstorage. in addition to the storage tanks, other operations that can produce\ncontaminants are the drilling operation itself and the cuttings drying operation. It\nis the purpose of this plan to define the prevention containment and\ncountermeasure plan for discharges from any of these sources on the site. All\nthe actions taken in this regard are per approved policies of this part of 40 CFR\n112. Universally and in setting up the drilling operation on the site prevention\nmeasures are taken by grading the site to contain discharges, building in\neffective valves and other related operational and control mechanisms to prevent\ndischarges. This equipment is installed and tested prior to beginning drilling\noperations. The tanks and equipment are installed within secondary containment\nberms and containment trenches and sumps are installed around the facilities\nprior to beginning drilling operations with capacity to contain with freeboard a\nrupture of the largest vessel associated with the containment. In the event of a\ndischarge the sites are equipped with vacuums that are capable of picking up the\nspilled material and loading it into containers where it can be transferred to an\napproved disposal location. In the event of a discharge larger than can be\nhandled by Cyclone and other manpower on location or that leaks offsite and\npotentially into navigable waters of the US, the operator, under his directions will\narrange for trained contract personnel to immediately contain and clean-up the\ndischarge.\n112.7(a)(2} This plan will comply with all applicable items of this part. With\nno deviations anticipated.\n412.7(a)(3} The attached sketch shows a typical layout of the drill rig sites\ndepicting the location, size and contents of the tanks. There are no\nunderground tanks nor are there any mobile or portable containers\nassociated with these drilling locations. The site is prepared in advance of\nthe drill rig coming onto the site. The sites are designed and constructed to\ncontain spills and tank ruptures on the site. The drill rig and associated tanks\nand equipment are laid out in an efficient and effective manner to streamline the\ndrilling operation. Frack tanks are located in such a manner that they have easy\naccess to the mud tanks with valves located on both ends of transfer lines. The\ndrilling mud tanks are plumbed to the drill rig with valves appropriately located to\nPage 1 of 6"

A dated record of the\ninspection, signed by the appropriate supervisor or inspector is recorded and\nfiled with time sheets or safety meeting minutes, when the drill tig changes\nlocations and notes of deficiencies or acceptance are included. Operation and\nmaintenance of equipment is designed to prevent discharges. Personnel are\ntrained and made aware of the discharge prevention procedures and applicable\npollution control laws, rules and regulations. The tool pusher in charge of the drill\nsig will have in his possession a copy of the Cyclone Drilling SPCC Plan and it is\nhis responsibility to instruct the employees and make them aware of the\ndischarge prevention measures contained in the plan. Scheduled briefings and\ntefreshers are to be conducted with all the employees prior to and during rig up\noperations, such briefings are to be held during regularly scheduled safety\nmeetings.\n\nEmployees are assigned to make routine inspections of valves, hose connections\nand other fluid connections for leaks. These inspections are made and\ndocumented on a monthly basis at a minimum. These leaks are provided drip\npans and reported to the appropriate personnel for repair. If repairs cannot be\nreadily made then regular emptying of the drip pans is required until the repairs\ncan be made. Inspections of trenches and sumps are made on a regular basis to\ninsure that they are free flowing and functional. The containment berms are also\ninspected periodically to insure their stability and function.\n\n112.7(a)(3)(iii) Discharge or drainage controls such as secondary\ncontainment around containers and other structures, equipment, and\nprocedures for the control of the discharge; Containment berms are placed\naround the tanks containing crude oil, the invert dritling fluid, salt water tanks and\nthe empty tanks to be used for emergency storage, as secondary containment.\nThe containment berms are of adequate height to contain a rupture and total\nfailure of the largest tank contained within it amounting to 400 BBLS requiring a\ncontainment capacity of 3,000 cu. ft. Similarly, berms are built around the crude\noil storage tanks on the site and requiring the same containment volume. Berms\nor trenches and sumps are constructed around the drill rig itself, the drilling mud\ntanks and diesel fuel tank, the sumps and trenches are sized to contain the\nvolume of the largest tank in the case of a rupture and complete failure.\nAdditionally, drip pans are placed under leaking valves, hose joints and other\nsources of smail leaks until the item can be replaced or repaired to not leak.\nRegular inspections of these facilities are made to insure that they will function\nper plan.\n\n112.7(a)(3)(iv) Countermeasures for discharge discovery, response, and\ncleanup (both the facility's capability and those that might be required of a\ncontractor); Regular inspections may reveal a discharge such as a leaking\nvalve or hose joint. These instances can readily be cleaned up by employees of\nCyclone Orilling using on site vacuums and containers. Larger spills up to and\n\nPage 3 of 6"
