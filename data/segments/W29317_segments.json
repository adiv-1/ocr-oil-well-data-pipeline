The primary pay \nzone extended from 13\u2019-24\u2019 below the top of the Three Forks. This pay zone was picked \nfor its production potential and quality of reservoir rock. The objective was to steer the \nwell within the defined pay zone and within the legal requirements of the state. \nDirectional drilling was performed by RPM and MWD services were performed by Ryan \nDirectional Services. Mark Miller and Adam Harris were the primary well site geologists; \nproviding geo-steering and mud logging from Columbine Logging, Inc. \n \nWell Information \n \n \nAPI #:  33-053-06232  \n \n \n                  Field: Baker \n \nSpud Date: 01/19/2015                                                   TD Date: 3/2/2015 \n \nSurface Location:  SW SW SEC 31, T153N, R100W, 713' FSL & 320'FWL, McKenzie \nCounty, North Dakota \n \nIntermediate Casing Point:  SW SW  SEC 31, T153N, R100W, McKenzie County, \nNorth Dakota; 11,295\u2019 MD, 10,883\u2019 TVD                          \n                                                                                                                                            \nBottom Hole Location:  SE SE SEC 32, T153N, R100W, McKenzie County, North \nDakota, 20,550\u2019 MD, 10932.38\u2019 TVD \n \nSurface Elevation: 2,158'                                                  KB: 2183' \n  \nCasing Shoe: 11,295\u2019 MD, 10,883\u2019 TVD                         Total Depth Drilled: 20550\u2019 \n \nOperator: Oasis Petroleum North America LLC             Rig: Nabors B27                             \n \nWell-site Geologist: Mark Miller, Adam Harris  \nDD: RPM \n \nMud logging:  Columbine Logging                                  Mud Service:  Mi Swaco                                          \n \nMWD: Ryan Directional Services \n \n \n       Drilling Mud: Invert, Brine\n\n3 \n \n2.0 SERVICES \n \n2.1 Well site Geology (Columbine Logging, Inc.) \n \nGeological consulting and mud logging started on 1/19/2015. Services provided included; \nmorning reports, evening reports, noon and midnight reports, sample examination, \nsample recording via pictures, production of vertical and horizontal mudlog, geo steering, \nsample collection and bagging, sample mailing and a final end of well report. \n \n2.1.1 Geosteering \n \nOur primary offset GR TVD log was the Gramma Federal 5300 41-31 31T well, located \n33\u2019 south on the same pad.  From this offset log the Three Forks was determined to be \napproximately 26\u2019 feet thick.  Within the Three Forks, the primary objective was to stay \nwithin an 6\u2019 thick target window within the Three Forks \u201cA\u201d unit, which extended from \n13\u2019 to 26\u2019 below the top of the Three Forks. Gamma patterns were compared with the \noffset log and a TVD log was created while landing the curve to in order to land in the \ntargeted zone.  Steering in the lateral was accomplished by calculating dip from relevant \ngamma markers, as well as by using lithology, total gas and ROP to determine our \nposition within the formation. \n \n2.1.2 Gamma and Surveys \n \nGamma and survey MWD services were provided by Ryan Directional Services.  The \nupper 13\u2019 of the Three Forks, referred to as the \u201cB\u201d unit, consisted of overall high gamma \ncompared to the \u201cA\u201d unit.  The highest gamma readings of 170 api were just above the \ntarget line.  The top of the \u201cA\u201d was marked by a gamma peak of approximately 120 api.  \nThe \u201cA\u201d unit extended from 14\u2019 to 26\u2019 below the upper shale. The upper portion of the \n\u201cA\u201d consisted of lower gamma readings of 55 \u2013 85 api. \nThe \u201cA\u201d unit was expected to extend from 14\u2019 to 26\u2019 below the top of the Three Forks, \nbased on an offset Three Forks well on the same pad.  The 13T wellbore dropped into the \nclaystone, confirming the basic thickness of the zone.  The base of the \u201cA\u201d had a clean \nsection of gamma, followed by the Claystone 1.  After landing the curve, the wellbore \nwas drilled almost entirely within the \u201cB\u201d and \u201cA\u201d units.\n\n4 \n \n2.2 Mud Logging (Columbine Logging, Inc.) \n \n2.2.1 Sample Examination \n \nSamples were collected every 30 ft in the straight hole and build section, and every 30 ft \nwhile drilling the lateral. Descriptions included; mineralogy, color, firmness, argillaceous \ncontent, structure, texture, allochems, porosity, oil stain, and hydrocarbon fluorescence. \nCarbonate identification was determined with 10% dilute HCl-, alizarin red and \ncalcimeter. Hydrocarbon fluorescence was determined using a fluoroscope with a UV \nlamp.   \n \n \n2.2.2 Gas Detection \n \nGas was logged using a Bloodhound total gas/chromatograph system. The gas detection \nsystem uses an infra-red detector to measure total gas and the chromatograph separates \nand measures gases C1, C2, C3, iC4 and nC4. Gas was recorded in units where 1 unit \nequals 100 ppm. The gas detection system measured gases: C1, C2, C3, IC4, NC4, IC5, \nNC5, H2S, O2 and CO2.  \n \nThe Bloodhound Gas Detection and Chromatograph system use digital signal processing \ntechniques and non-dispersive infrared and chemical sensors for gas detection.  The \nsystem uses a proprietary chromatograph, which has the capability to detect from 0 to \n10,000 gas units.  This translates as 0 to 100% typical naturally-occurring hydrocarbon \ngas mixtures.  Calibration is performed using National Institute of Standards and \nTechnology (NIST) traceable calibration gases.  Lab calibration points include 0%, 2.5%, \nand 100% pure methane.  Complete immunity to saturation or damage in the presence of \nhigh concentrations of both light and heavy hydrocarbon gases precludes the necessity of \nconstant re-calibration or zero referencing. This allows the Bloodhound to react to \nhydrocarbon based gases from zero to 100% in concentration without dilution. \n \nLag time was approximated from a calculation of annular velocity based on: pump \noutput, open-hole diameter, cased hole diameter, collar diameter, drill pipe diameter and \nbottom hole assembly. Connection gases were monitored to confirm lag time calculations \nand thereby adjust lag time when needed.\n\n5 \n \n \n \n3.0 GEOLOGY \n \n3.1 Formation Tops Formation tops are picked using ROP, lithology, and gamma ray.

The oil-based mud contributed a background gas of 100-150 \nunits, and saturated cuttings with oil, making all cuttings in the vertical show the same \ncut and fluorescence.  Within the lateral, Gas shows increased as the lateral progressed.  \nThe beginning of the lateral had shows of 600-1500 units, which slightly increased to \npeaks of 2000 units at connections, with a background of 1500 units. Flares were \nintermittent at 3\u2019 to 10\u2019.  \n \n3.5 Oil Shows \nInvert mud was used in the vertical, masking any oil shows. In the lateral part of the well \nthe oil shows were described as: Frequent-abundant dull to bright yellow-green \nflorescence with a moderate to flash streaming-diffuse bright blue cut fluorescence and a \nmedium brown residue ring.  \n \n \n \n \n \n3.6 Gas Shows \nGas logged while drilling the lateral is shown in Figure 3.6.\n\n8 \n \n4.0 WELL HISTORY \nA summary of the daily progress of the well is listed below (Table 4.0). \n \n24 HR.

The \nwell was drilled to completion at 17:30 hours, 3/02/2015.  The projected bottom hole \nlocation is: SE SE SEC 32, T153N, R100W, McKenzie County, North Dakota, with a \nprojected TVD of 10,932.98\u2019. \n \nThe targeted pay zone for the wellbore was a window within the Three Forks first bench.  \nThis window extended from 13\u2019 to 24\u2019 below the top of the Three Forks. The anticipated \ndip of the formation was 0.5 degrees down overall, with a possibly dip reversal structure \nbetween 16000\u2019 MD and 17500\u2019 MD.  Anticipated dip was based on a subsurface \nstructure map provided by Oasis Petroleum, and nearby laterals. Our primary offset GR \nTVD log was from the Gramma Federal 5300 41-31 31T, located on the same pad, 33\u2019 to \nthe south. From this offset log the Three Forks was determined to be approximately 26\u2019 \nfeet thick \n \nThe formation had an average dip of 89.6 degrees.  The anticipated dip reversal was \nencountered. We did see a flattening to 90.1 degrees between 16000\u2019 and 17500\u2019.  Gas \nreadings and oil shows were best in the lower 5\u2019-6\u2019 of the Three Forks \u201cA\u201d.   \n \nCurrently the well is awaiting completion. \n \n________________________________________________________________________ \n \n \nMark Miller, Adam Harris, Well-Site Geologists \nColumbine Logging, Inc. \n602 S.

Oasis intends to drill the surface hole with freshwater based drilling mud and set surface casing with a \nsmall drilling rig and move off within 3 to 5 days. The casing will be set at a depth pre-approved by the NDIC per the \nApplication for Permit to Drill NDAC 43-02-03-21 . No saltwater will be used In the drilling and cementing operations \nof the surface casing. Once the surface casing Is cemented, a plug or mechanical seal will be placed at the top of the \ncasing to prevent any foreign matter from getting Into the well. A rig capable of drilling to TD will move onto the \nlocation within the 90 days previously outlined to complete the drilling and casing plan as per the APO. The \nundersigned states that this request for suspension of drilling operations in accordance with the Subsection 4 of \nSection 43-02-03-55 of the NDAC, Is being requested to take advantage of the cost savings and time savings of using \nan initial rig that is smaller than the rig necessary to drill a well to total depth but Is not Intended to alter or extend \nthe terms and conditions of, or suspend any obligation under, any oil and gas lease with acreage In or under the \nspacing or drilling unit for the above-referenced well. Oasis understands NDAC 43-02-03-31 requirements regarding \nconfidentiality pertaining to this permit. The lined reserve pit will be fenced immediately after construction If the well \npad is located in a pasture (NDAC 43-02-03-19 & 19.1 ). Oasis will plug and abandon the well and reclaim the well site \nif the well is not drilled by the larger rotary rig within 90 days after spudding the well with the smaller drilling rig. \n/V/)I (. \n[NS evTdR. \nCompany \nOasis Petroleum North America, LLC \nAddress \n1001 Fannin, Suite 1500 \nEmail Address \nlstanfield@oaslspetroleum.com \nTelephone Number \n(281) 404-9562 \nState \nZip Code \nTX \n77002 \nPrinted Name \nLauri M.

Oasis intends to drill the surface hole with freshwater based drilling mud and set surface casing with a \nsmall drilling rig and move off within 3 to 5 days. The casing will be set at a depth pre-approved by the NDIC per the \nApplication for Permit to Drill NDAC 43\u00b702-03-21. No saltwater will be used in the drilling and cementing operations \nof the surface casing. Once the surface casing Is cemented, a plug or mechanical seal will be placed at the top of the \ncasing to prevent any foreign matter from getting Into the well. A rig capable of drilling to TD will move onto the \nlocation within the 90 days previously outlined to complete the drilling and casing plan as per the APO. The \nundersigned states that this request for suspension of drilling operations in accordance with the Subsection 4 of \nSection 43-02-03-55 of the NDAC, Is being requested to take advantage of the cost savings and time savings of using \nan Initial rig that Is smaller than the rig necessary to drill a well to total depth but is not Intended to alter or extend \nthe terms and conditions of, or suspend any obligation under, any oil and gas lease with acreage In or under the \nspacing or drilling unit for the above-referenced well. Oasis understands NDAC 43-02-03-31 requirements regarding \nconfidentiality pertaining to this permit. The lined reserve pit will be fenced immediately after construction If the well \npad Is located In a pasture (NDAC 43-02-03-19 & 19.1). Oasis will plug and abandon the well and reclaim the well site \nif the well Is not drilled by the larger rotary rig within 90 days after spudding the well with the smaller drilling rig. \nEmail Address \nlstanfleld@oaslspetroleum.com \nState \nZip Code \nTX \n77002 \nPrinted Name \nLauri M.

Stanfield \nRegulatory Specialist \nOASIS PETROLEUM NORTH AMERICA LLC \n1001 Fannin Street, Suite 1500 \nHouston, TX 77002 \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \nRE:      HORIZONTAL  WELL \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nGRAMMA FEDERAL  5300 41-31 13T2 \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nLOT4 Section 31-153N-100W \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nMcKenzie County \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nWell File # 29317 \n \nDear Lauri: \n \n   Pursuant to Commission Order No. 23752, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The \napproval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than \nthe 500' setback from the north & south boundaries and 200' setback from the east & west boundaries within \nthe 1280 acre spacing unit consisting of Sections 31 & 32 T153N R100W.  \n \nPERMIT STIPULATIONS: Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for \nfilter sock disposal must be maintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, and must \nremain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations are \nconducted.  Also, OASIS PETROLEUM NORTH AMERICA LLC must contact NDIC Field Inspector \nRichard Dunn at 701-770-3554 prior to location construction. \n \nDrilling pit \nNDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that \u201ca pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well \ndrilling and completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will \nprevent pollution of the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits \nare prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized representative of the director prior to lining and use.  \nDrill cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings \npit.\u201d \n \nForm 1 Changes & Hard Lines  \n  Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.  \nThe proposed directional plan is at a legal location.  Based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum \nlegal coordinate from the well head is: 10016\u2019 E. \n \nLocation Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period) \n   Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the \napproved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report.   If circumstances require operations to \ncommence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may \nbe waived by the Director.  Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information \nnecessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other \ninformation that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the \ndrilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit.\n\nLauri M. Stanfield \nSeptember 3, 2014 \nPage 2 \n \nPermit Fee & Notification \n   Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card .The permit fee has been received.  It is requested \nthat notification be given immediately upon the spudding of the well.  This information should be relayed to the \nOil & Gas Division, Bismarck, via telephone.  The following information must be included:  Well name, legal \nlocation, permit number, drilling contractor, company representative, date and time of spudding.  Office hours are \n8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is (701) 328-8020, leave a \nmessage if after hours or on the weekend.  \n \nSurvey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells \n   NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey contractor \nshall file a certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion.  Surveys \nmust be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director may \nrequire the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the \noperation of the director's office in a timely manner.  Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe \ndocument, with a certification cover page to certsurvey@nd.gov.    \nSurvey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.  \nSpecifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve \n(or when sliding) and 90 feet in the lateral. \n \nSurface casing cement \n \nTail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12 \nhours, and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi \nbefore drilling the plug or initiating tests.   \n \nLogs \n \nNDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of (1) a suite of open hole logs from which formation tops and \nporosity zones can be determined, (2) a Gamma Ray Log run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore, and \n(3) a log from which the presence and quality of cement can be determined (Standard CBL or Ultrasonic cement evaluation \nlog) in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set, this log must be run prior to completing the well.  \nAll logs run must be submitted free of charge, as one digital TIFF (tagged image file format) copy and one digital LAS (log \nASCII) formatted copy. Digital logs may be submitted on a standard CD, DVD, or attached to an email sent to \ndigitallogs@nd.gov \n   \nThank you for your cooperation.  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nSincerely,

The Commission is very \nconcerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry. \n \nEffective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the \nwell is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations \nare conducted.  The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an \nauthorized facility.  Such containers must be: \n\uf0b7 \nleakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container \n\uf0b7 \ncovered to prevent precipitation from entering the container \n\uf0b7 \nplacard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container \n \nIf the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but \nonly upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request. \n \nAs previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01 \nstates in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production \nwastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste \nManagement.  Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the \nsolid waste program.  Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud, \ninvert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.  \n \nThank you for your cooperation.  \n \n \n \nSincerely, \n \n \n \nBruce E.
