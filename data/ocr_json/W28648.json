Nabors B22 drilling the Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC - Chalmers 5300 21-19 9B,  \nFebruary, 2015 in Baker Field, McKenzie County, North Dakota. \n \nINTRODUCTION  \n \nThe Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC Chalmers 5300 21-19 9B [Lot 2 Section 19, \nT153N, R100W] is located approximately 7 miles south of the town of Williston in McKenzie \nCounty, North Dakota. The Chalmers 5300 21-19 9B is a horizontal Middle Bakken well within \nthe Williston Basin consisting of one 9,369' (uncased) lateral drilled toward the east. The vertical \nhole was planned to be drilled to approximately 10,230\u2019. The curve would be built at 12 degrees \nper 100\u2019 to land within the Middle Bakken. This well is a two section lateral which originates in \nthe northwest quarter of section 19, then drilled east to the northeast quarter of section 20. \nDirectional drilling technologies and geosteering techniques were used to land in the Middle \nBakken reservoir and maintain exposure to the ideal target rock."

Offset well control was essential in curve operations, to \nsuccessfully land within the Middle Bakken. Formation thicknesses expressed by gamma ray \nsignatures in these wells were compared to gamma data collected during drilling operations in \norder to successfully land the curve. The target landing true vertical depth (TVD) was \nperiodically updated during drilling to ensure accurate landing of the curve.  \n \nGEOLOGY \n \nThe Charles Formation [Mississippian Madison Group] was logged 8,535' MD 8,535' TVD        \n(-6,459' SS). Samples in the lower portion of the Charles Formation consisted of a limestone \nmudstone, which was light brown, light gray brown, light gray brown, off white in color. It was \nmicrocrystalline, friable, laminated, with an earthy texture. A trace of intercrystalline porosity \nwas observed as was occasional to rare spotty light brown oil stain. Occasionally noted was a \ndolomite mudstone, which was light brown, light gray, light gray brown in color. It was \nmicrocrystalline, friable-firm, laminated, with an earthy texture. Also noted was a trace of \nintercrystalline porosity, and occasional spotty light brown oil stain. Rarely noted was anhydrite, \nwhich was off white, cream in color. It was soft, microcrystalline, and massive with an earthy to \namorphous texture. Following connections or periods of non-circulation, gas peaks of 40 to 42 \nunits were noted, as were drilling gas shows of 31 to 40 units.   \n \nThe Mission Canyon Formation [Mississippian Madison Group] was logged 9,435' MD 9,435' \nTVD (-7,359' SS). The Mission Canyon Formation consisted of a lime mudstone that was \ndescribed as light gray, light brown to brown, gray brown, trace dark gray in color. The lime \nmudstone was predominately friable to firm, with an earthy to rarely crystalline in texture. Some \nintervals contained a trace of black-brown algal material, a trace of fossil fragments, and traces \nof disseminated pyrite. Also present was an argillaceous lime mudstone that was described as \nlight gray, occasional medium gray, rare gray tan, rare off white, trace dark gray in color. The \nargillaceous lime mudstone was predominately firm to friable, crystalline to chalky texture. \nSome intervals contained a trace of disseminated pyrite. Gas shows of 33 to 64 units were \npresent. Rare intercrystalline porosity was noted as well as traces to occasional spotty light \nbrown oil stain was occasionally observed while logging the Mission Canyon Formation. \n \nThe Upper Bakken Shale [Mississippian-Bakken Formation] was drilled at 10,888' MD 10,727' \nTVD (-8,651' SS). Entry into this member was characterized by high gamma, elevated \nbackground gas and increased rates of penetration. The black to black gray carbonaceous and \npetroliferous shale was hard with a sub blocky to sub platy texture. Fracture porosity was noted, \nand trace minerals were observed to include disseminated pyrite and calcite fracture fill. \nHydrocarbons evaluated in this interval reached a maximum of 2,365 units drilling gas, with a \nconnection gas of 2,803 units."

The RPM directional drillers and MWD, and Sunburst Consulting personnel \nworked closely together throughout the project to evaluate data and make steering decisions to \nmaximize the amount of borehole in the targeted zones and increase rate of penetration (ROP) of \nthe formation.  \n \nThe 904\u2019 curve was drilled in 24 hours. It was drilled with a bottom hole assembly (BHA) \nconsisting of bit #3, a Security MMD55M PDC bit, attached to a 2.38 degree fixed NOV stage \n7/8 5.0 motor and MWD tools. The curve was successfully landed at 11,127\u2019 MD and 10,758\u2019 \nTVD, approximately 15\u2019 into the Middle Bakken. Seven inch diameter 32# HCP-110 casing was \nset to 11,071\u2019 MD.  \n \nGeologic structure maps of the Chalmers 5300 21-19 9B and surrounding control wells had \nestimated formation dip to be a down dip at approximately 0.5\u00ba down to the TD of the lateral. \nThe preferred drilling interval of the Chalmers 5300 21-19 9B consisted of a ten foot zone \nlocated approximately ten feet into the Middle Bakken. Penetration rates, gas shows, gamma ray \ndata, and sample observations were utilized to keep the wellbore in the preferred stratigraphic \nposition in the target zone. Using offset well data provided by Oasis representatives, projected \nporosity zones were identified in the preferred drilling areas.  \n \n \n \nFigure 6.  Offset well target definition, Indian Hills Prospect (Oasis).   \n \nSteering decisions were made by using gamma markers identified by Oasis representatives. The \nhigh gamma (C) in the upper portion of the drilling zone was useful in identifying the well bore \nplacement in formation. The slightly lower gamma (B) was observed as the well bore moved to \nthe top of the target zone, followed by lower gamma as the well bore moved higher, out of the \ntarget zone. Low gamma in the middle of the target zone (D) was noted as the well bore moved \nto the middle of the target zone. As the well bore moved lower in formation, the higher gamma \n(E) was noted as was lower gamma as the well bore moved lower in formation, exiting the target \nzone. Samples collected when drilling below the target zone tended to have a greater \nconcentration of the light gray to gray silty sandstone than did the samples collected when the \nwell bore was higher in the target zone.

Surveys \nmust be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director may \nrequire the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the \noperation of the director's office in a timely manner.  Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe \ndocument, with a certification cover page to certsurvey@nd.gov.    \nSurvey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.  \nSpecifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve \n(or when sliding) and 90 feet in the lateral. \n \nSurface casing cement \n \nTail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12 \nhours, and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi \nbefore drilling the plug or initiating tests.   \n \nLogs \n \nNDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of (1) a suite of open hole logs from which formation tops and \nporosity zones can be determined, (2) a Gamma Ray Log run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore, and \n(3) a log from which the presence and quality of cement can be determined (Standard CBL or Ultrasonic cement evaluation \nlog) in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set, this log must be run prior to completing the well.  \nAll logs run must be submitted free of charge, as one digital TIFF (tagged image file format) copy and one digital LAS (log \nASCII) formatted copy.

The Commission is very \nconcerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry. \n \nEffective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the \nwell is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations \nare conducted.  The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an \nauthorized facility.  Such containers must be: \n\uf0b7 \nleakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container \n\uf0b7 \ncovered to prevent precipitation from entering the container \n\uf0b7 \nplacard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container \n \nIf the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but \nonly upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request. \n \nAs previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01 \nstates in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production \nwastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste \nManagement.  Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the \nsolid waste program.  Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud, \ninvert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.  \n \nThank you for your cooperation.  \n \n \n \nSincerely, \n \n \n \nBruce E.
