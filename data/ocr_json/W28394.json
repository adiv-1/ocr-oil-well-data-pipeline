    "text": "1.0 INTRODUCTION \n \nWade Federal 5200 41-30 4T  is a East lateral Three Forks 1st Bench well located in SEC 30, \nT153N, R100W in McKenzie County, North Dakota. The primary pay zone was approximately \n20\u2019 under the base of the Pronghorn member of the Bakken formation. This pay zone was picked \nfor its production potential and quality of reservoir rock.

Services provided included; \nmorning reports, evening reports, noon and midnight reports, sample examination, sample \nrecording via pictures, production of vertical and horizontal mudlog, geo steering, sample \ncollection and bagging, sample mailing and a final end of well report. \n \n2.1.1 Geosteering \n \nOur offset GR TVD logs were from the Wade Federal 5300 41-30 7T well, located on the same \nwell pad as Wade Federal 5300 41-30 4T. Within the Three Forks 1st Bench, the primary \nobjective was to stay near the middle gamma markers which marks the inter layering between \nlimy sandstones and siltstone. Gamma patterns were compared with the offset log and a TVD log \nwas created while landing the curve to in order to land in the targeted zone.  Steering in the \nlateral was accomplished by calculating dip from relevant gamma markers, as well as by using \nlithology, total gas and ROP to determine our position within the formation. \n \n2.1.2 Gamma and Surveys \n \nGamma and survey MWD services were provided by Schlumberger/Pathfinder/Ryan.  The \nmajority of the well was drilled within the target area of the Three Forks 1st Bench.   \n \n2.2 Mud Logging (Columbine Logging, Inc.) \n \n2.2.1 Sample Examination \n \nSamples were collected every 30 ft in the straight hole and build section, and every 30 ft while \ndrilling the lateral. Descriptions included; mineralogy, color, firmness, argillaceous content, \nstructure, texture, allochems, porosity, oil stain, and hydrocarbon fluorescence. Carbonate \nidentification was determined with 10% dilute HCl-, alizarin red and calcimeter. Hydrocarbon \nfluorescence was determined using a fluoroscope with a UV lamp.   \n \n2.2.2 Gas Detection \n \nGas was logged using a Bloodhound total gas/chromatograph system. The gas detection system \nuses an infra-red detector to measure total gas and the chromatograph separates and measures \ngases C1, C2, C3, iC4 and nC4. Gas was recorded in units where 1 unit equals 100 ppm. The gas \ndetection system measured gases: C1, C2, C3, iC4, nC4, H2S, O2 and CO2.  \n \nThe Bloodhound Gas Detection and Chromatograph system use digital signal processing \ntechniques and non-dispersive infrared and chemical sensors for gas detection.  The system uses \na proprietary chromatograph, which has the capability to detect from 0 to 10,000 gas units.  This \ntranslates as 0 to 100% typical naturally-occurring hydrocarbon gas mixtures.  Calibration is \nperformed using National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) traceable calibration \ngases.  Lab calibration points include 0%, 2.5%, and 100% pure methane.

This \nallows the Bloodhound to react to hydrocarbon based gases from zero to 100% in concentration \nwithout dilution. \n \nLag time was approximated from a calculation of annular velocity based on: pump output, open-\nhole diameter, cased hole diameter, collar diameter, drill pipe diameter and bottom hole \nassembly. Connection gases were monitored to confirm lag time calculations and adjustments \nwere made when necessary."

    "text": "5.0 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION \n \nWade Federal 5300 41-30 4T is a East lateral Three Forks 1st Bench well located in SEC 30, \nT153N, R100W in McKenzie County, North Dakota. The primary pay zone was 20\u2019 under the \nbottom of the Pronghorn member of the Bakken formation. This pay zone was picked for its \nproduction potential and quality of reservoir rock. The objective was to steer the well within the \ndefined pay zone and within the legal requirements of the state.  \n \nThe primary objective was to stay near the middle gamma markers which marks the inter \nlayering between limy sandstones and siltstones. Gamma patterns were compared with the offset \nlog and a TVD log was created while landing the curve to in order to land in the targeted zone.  \nSteering in the lateral was accomplished by calculating dip from relevant gamma markers, as \nwell as by using lithology, total gas and ROP to determine our position within the formation. \n \nThe formation had an average dip of 89.25\u03bf. Refer to Figure 4.1 on page 6 for a detailed \nformation dip profile.  \n \nAs Per Brendan Hargrove, Oasis Operations Geologist: \nThe well landed at 10791\u2019 TVD, ~6\u2019 into the Claystone. In the first few hundred feet of the \nlateral, we continued down-section deeper into the Claystone as we attempted to get our INC up. \nWe re-entered the Three Forks at ~11600\u2019 MD and slowly traversed up to the top of our target \nwindow, near the \u201cC\u201d marker. The \u201cC\u201d marker had abundant pyrite, and the bit seemed to not \nwant to react to downslides from this position. We were getting good ROPs, though, so we \ndrilled ahead in the top of target for ~2000\u2019. Around 15500\u2019 MD, bed dips began shallowing out \nas expected based on offset data, and we traversed down section, encountering the Claystone \nagain at ~17000\u2019 MD. We drilled ~200\u2019 of Claystone, then quickly rose back up into the top of \nthe target window again (\u201cC\u201d marker) and drilled ahead to TD. As mentioned above, we suffered \na motor failure late last night at 20193\u2019 MD, ~400\u2019 from our planned TD. The question of \nwhether it was worthwhile to trip and drill the remained of the lateral was discussed, and it was \ndetermined that we would call TD slightly early. \n \nCurrently the well is awaiting completion. \n \n________________________________________________________________________ \n \n \nHeather A.

Oasis intends to drill the surface hole with freshwater based drilling mud and set surface casing with a \nsmall drilling rig and move off within 3 to 5 days. The casing will be set at a depth pre-approved by the NDIC per the \nApplication for Permit to Drill NDAC 43-02-03-21. No saltwater will be used in the drilling and cementing operations \nof the surface casing. Once the surface casing is cemented, a plug or mechanical seal will be placed at the top of the \ncasing to prevent any foreign matter from getting into the well. A rig capable of drilling to TD wlll move onto the \nlocation within the 90 days previously outlined to complete the drilling and casing plan as per the APO. The \nundersigned states that this request for suspension of drilling operations in accordance with the Subsection 4 of \nSection 43-02-03-55 of the NDAC, is being requested to take advantage of the cost savings and time savings of using \nan initial rig that is smaller than the rig necessary to drill a well to total depth but is not intended to alter or extend \nthe terms and conditions of, or suspend any obligation under, any oll and gas lease with acreage in or under the \nspacing or drilling unit for the above-referenced well. Oasis understands NDAC 43-02-03-31 requirements regarding \nconfidentiality pertaining to this permit. The lined reserve pit will be fenced immediately after construction if the well \npad is located in a pasture (NDAC 43-02-03-19 & 19.1 ). Oasis will plug and abandon the well and reclaim the well site \nif the well is not drilled by the larger rotary rig within 90 days after spudding the well with the smaller drilling rig. \nCompany \n'Telephone Number \nOasis Petroleum North America, LLC \n(281) 404-9562 \nFOR STATE USE ONLY \nAddress \n1001 Fannin, Suite 1500 \nD Received \nI D Approved \nCity \n'State \nIZip Code \nHouston \nTX \n77002 \nDale \nS~11,ap.ne \n/ \n<) \nPrin1ed Name \n\u2022\u2022\n. > \n... \n}~/, \n.,,\u00a3~/ \n, \n\"\"'\u00b0 \nLauri M.

The approval is granted on the \ncondition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than the 500' setback from the north & south boundaries \nand 200' setback from the east & west boundaries within the 1280 acre spacing unit consisting of Sections 29 & 30 T153N R100W.  Tool \nerror is not required pursuant to order. \n \nPERMIT STIPULATIONS:  Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for filter sock disposal must \nbe maintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and \nflow-back whenever filtration operations are conducted.  OASIS PETROLEUM NORTH AMERICA LLC must take into \nconsideration NDAC 43-02-03-28 (Safety Regulation) when contemplating simultaneous operations on the above captioned \nlocation.  Pursuant to NDAC 43-02-03-28 (Safety Regulation) \u201cNo boiler, portable electric lighting generator, or treater shall be \nplaced nearer than 150 feet to any producing well or oil tank.\u201d  Due to drainage adjacent to the well site, a dike is required \nsurrounding the entire location.

The Commission is very \nconcerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry. \n \nEffective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the \nwell is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations \nare conducted.  The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an \nauthorized facility.  Such containers must be: \n\uf0b7 \nleakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container \n\uf0b7 \ncovered to prevent precipitation from entering the container \n\uf0b7 \nplacard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container \n \nIf the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but \nonly upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request. \n \nAs previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01 \nstates in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production \nwastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste \nManagement.  Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the \nsolid waste program.  Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud, \ninvert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.  \n \nThank you for your cooperation.  \n \n \n \nSincerely, \n \n \n \nBruce E. Hicks \n \n \nAssistant Director"
