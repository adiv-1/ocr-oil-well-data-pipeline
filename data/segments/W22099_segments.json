Yukon 5301 41-12T [SW SW Sec. 12-T153N-R101W] is \nlocated approximately 3 miles south of Williston in McKenzie County, North Dakota. The \nYukon 5301 41-12T is a horizontal Three Forks development well in part of Oasis Petroleum\u2019s \nCamp prospect within the Williston Basin. The vertical hole was planned to be drilled to \napproximately 10,335\u2019. The curve would be built at 12 degrees per 100\u2019 to land within the Three \nForks. This well is a two section lateral which originates in the southwest quarter of section 12, \nthen drilled south across section 13, to the southwest quarter of section 24 (Figure 2). Directional \ndrilling technologies and geo-steering techniques were used to land in the upper Three Forks \nreservoir and maintain exposure to the ideal target rock.\n\n-11000\n-10500\n-10000\n-9500\n-9000\n-8500\n-8000\n-7500\n-7000\n-6500\n-6000\n-5500\n-5000\n-4500\n-4000\n-3500\n-3000\n-2500\n-2000\n-1500\n-1000\n-500\n0\n-1000\n-500\n0\n500\n1000\n1500\n2000\n2500\n3000\n3500\n4000\n4500\n5000\n5500\n6000\n6500\n7000\n7500\n8000\n8500\n9000\n9500\n10000\nW-E\nN-S\nPLAN VIEW\nBottom Hole Location: \n10,504.47' S & 618.46' E\nof surface location or approx.  \n295.55' FSL & 1,328.46' FWL\nSE SW Sec. 24, T153N, R101W\nSurface: 255' FSL & 710' FWL\nSW SW Sec. 12, T153N, R101W\nMcKenzie County, ND\nOasis Petroleum North America, LLC\nYukon 5301 41-12 T\n24\n13\nNote: 1,280 acre standup spacing unit \nwith 200' N/S & 500' E/W setbacks\nO\nBottom Hole Location: \n9,858.94' S & 594.66' E\nof surface location or approx.  \n941.08' FSL & 1,304.66' FWL\nSW SW Sec. 24, T153N, R101W\n \nFigure 2.

The Gulf Oil Exploration and Production, Lindvig 1-11-3C [SE SE \nSec. 11, T153N, R101W] is located approximately \u00bd of a mile west of the Yukon 5301 41-12T. \nThis well was completed in March of 1982 reached a total depth of 13,800\u2019 true vertical depth \n(TVD). The Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC Ash Federal 5300 11-18T [Lot 1 Section 18, \nT153N, R100W] is located approximately east north east of the Yukon 5301 41-12T. This well \nwas drilled to the Three Forks landing of 10,794\u2019 MD in August and September of 2012. The \nformation thicknesses expressed by gamma signatures in these wells, and the Oasis Petroleum \nNorth America, LLC Larry 5301 44-12B [SE NE Section 12, T153N, R101W] were used to \nassist in landing the curve. This was accomplished by comparing gamma signatures from the \noffset wells to gamma data collected during drilling operations. The casing target landing was \nperiodically updated to ensure accurate landing of the curve. Data used in this evaluation are \nincluded as an appendix to this report.\n\nFigure 3.  Structure map of the Three Forks Top (subsea) with annotated offset wells (Oasis Petroleum). \n \nENGINEERING  \n \nRyan Energy Technologies provided personnel and equipment for measurement-while-drilling \n(MWD) services. The RPM directional drillers MWD and Sunburst Consulting personnel \nworked closely together throughout the project to evaluate data and make steering decisions to \nmaximize the amount of borehole in the targeted zones and increase rate of penetration (ROP) of \nthe formation.  \n \nVertical \n \nThe Yukon 5301 41-12T was spud on 18 June, 2013 by Nabors B22. A 13 \u00bd\u201d hole was drilled \nwith fresh water to 2,127\u2019 and isolated with 9 \u215d\u201d J-55 casing cemented to surface. After surface \ncasing was set, the drilling fluid was changed to diesel invert with target weight of 9.6-10.2 ppg \nfor the vertical hole and 10.3-10.55 ppg for curve operations. The vertical hole was drilled from \nsurface casing with bit #2 a Security MMD55M attached to a Hunting 7/8 low speed motor. This \nassembly drilled to the KOP of 10,300\u2019 MD, drilling 8,173\u2019 in 65 hours.  \n \nCurve  \n \nThe 873\u2019 curve was drilled in 22.5 hours with bit #3 a Security MMD55D, attached to a 2.38 \ndegree fixed National 7/8 5 stage mud motor and MWD tools. The curve was successfully landed \nat 11,173\u2019 MD, approximately 8\u2019 into the Three Forks Formation. Seven inch diameter 32# \nHCP-110 casing was set to 11,173\u2019 MD. During casing operations circulation was lost. Casing\n\nwas worked up and down in an attempt to restore circulation, but all efforts to restore circulation \nfailed. A wire-line truck was called in and casing was perforated at 10,820\u2019 MD. Circulation was \nrestored and casing was cemented.  \n \nLateral  \n \nAfter completion of curve operations, MWD tools and bit #4, a 6\u201d Security MMD64D PDC bit, \nattached to a 1.5\u00ba adjustable Baker XLLS low speed motor were run in the hole. This bottom \nhole assembly (BHA) drilled 2,502\u2019 in 47 hours before erratic pulses from the MWD tool caused \nit to be tripped out of hole (TOH). A new BHA consisting of bit #5 a Smith MDSI613QBPX \nPDC bit, a new 1.5\u00ba adjustable Baker XLLS low speed motor and new MWD tools were tripped \ninto the hole (TIH). This assembly drilled 2,502\u2019 in 47 hours before the MWD tool ceased \npulsing, and this BHA was TOH. A new assembly consisting of bit #6 a Smith MDSI613QBPX \nPDC bit, a new 1.5\u00ba adjustable Baker XLLS low speed motor and new MWD tools were tripped \ninto the hole. This assembly drilled 3,165\u2019 in 56 hours before poor penetration rates caused it to \nbe TOH. A new assembly consisting of bit #7 a Varel VM613P2 PDC bit, a new 1.5\u00ba adjustable \nBaker XLLS low speed motor and the previously run MWD tools were tripped into the hole. \nThis assembly drilled to 20,573\u2019, drilling 904\u2019 in 23 hours before an encounter with the \npronghorn caused a sidetrack. The BHA was tripped back to 20,275\u2019 MD and the hole was \ntroughed, then time drilled for a sidetrack.  The sidetrack was unsuccessful, consequently bit #7 \nafter time drilling 5\u2019 in 21 hours was TOH. A new assembly consisting of bit #8, a Smith \nMDSI613 attached to a NOV 7/8 3.8 motor along with new MWD tools was assembled and TIH \nfor sidetrack attempt #2. This sidetrack was successful; this assembly drilled 457\u2019 in 27 hours \nbefore poor penetration rates caused it to be TOH.  A new BHA consisting of bit #9 a 6\u201d Security \nMMD64D PDC bit, a new 1.5\u00ba adjustable Baker XLLS low speed motor and new MWD tools \nwere tripped into the hole. This assembly drilled to TD, drilling 498\u2019 in 8.5 hours.  \n \nTotal depth of 21,220\u2019, with a final azimuth of 175.70\u00b0 and inclination of 89.5\u00b0 was achieved at \n1550 hours CDT July 16, 2013.  The resulting final vertical section was 10,522.61\u2019. The bottom \nhole location (BHL) is 10,504.47 south & 618.46' east of surface location or approximately \n295.55' FSL & 1,328.46' FWL, SE SW Sec. 24, T153N, R101W. The hole was then circulated \nand reamed for completion.\n\nGEOLOGY  \n \nMethods  \n \nGeologic analysis for the Yukon 5301 41-12T was provided by Sunburst Consulting, Inc. \nInformation was networked through Rig-watch\u2019s electronic data recorder system. This \ninformation network provided depth, drilling rate, pump strokes and total gas units to multiple \nareas throughout the well site. Gas data was fed from Sunburst\u2019s digital gas detector, a total gas \nchromatograph, through Rig-watch for dissemination. Hydrocarbon constituents (C1 through C4) \nwere recorded in part-per-million concentrations. Gas sampling was pulled through \u00bc\u201d polyflo \ntubing after agitation in Sunburst\u2019s gas trap at the shakers. Rig crews caught lagged samples at \nthe direction of the well site geologists. Samples were collected at 30\u2019 intervals in the \nvertical/curve and 30\u2019 intervals in the lateral. Rock cuttings were analyzed in wet and dry \nconditions under a 10x45 power binocular microscope (for detailed lithologic descriptions see \nappendix). Cuttings were sent to North Dakota Geologic Survey. In addition to rock samples, \nrate of penetration and gamma ray data were also used in geologic analysis to aid geo-steering \nand dip calculations.  \n \nLithology \n \nFormation analysis began at 8,240\u2019 MD with a siltstone and anhydrite characteristic of the \nKibbey Formation [Mississippian Big Snowy Group]. This interval consisted of an earthy, red to \norange, red brown, light orange to off white, trace light brown, friable siltstone that was \nmoderately calcite cemented with an earthy texture. The Kibbey \u201cLime\u201d was logged at 8,366' \nMD 8,365' TVD (-6,246') (SS). This marker is represented by an off white anhydrite which was \nmicrocrystalline, soft, massive, and amorphous. The anhydrite is often accompanied by slower \npenetration rates as the bit transitions out of the overlying siltstone. The rate of penetration \n(ROP) then increases as the bit exits the anhydrite cap to this marker and enters the underlying \nlimestone mudstone to wackestone. This carbonate was described as a light gray light gray \nbrown, off white lime mudstone which was microcrystalline, friable, and dense with an earthy \ntexture. Samples in the lower section consisted of red to orange, red brown, light orange to off \nwhite, trace light brown, friable and blocky siltstone with calcite cement moderately cemented. \nThis facies was interbedded with soft, off white amorphous or microcrystalline anhydrite.  \n \nThe Charles Formation [Mississippian Madison Group] consisted of salt, anhydrite, limestone \nand argillaceous lime mudstone. The first Charles salt was drilled at 8,508' MD 8,507' TVD (-\n6,338') SS. The Base of the Last Salt (BLS) was logged at 9,214' MD 9,212' TVD (-7,093') SS as \nindicated by slower penetration rates and increased weight on bit. The beds of salt within the \nCharles Formation can be identified by an increase in penetration rates and lower API gamma \ncount rates. Samples of the salt intervals were described as frosted, translucent, anhedral to \nsubhedral, with no visible porosity. Slower penetration rates were observed as the bit \nencountered sections of light brown, gray brown, gray, gray brown lime mudstone which was \nfriable to firm and dense, with an earthy texture. This limestone was argillaceous in part in areas \nwhere gamma API counts were elevated, and contained a trace of disseminated pyrite. No visible \noil stain was noted. In areas where the penetration rates were slowest anhydrite was logged. \nThese samples were described as off white, light gray, soft, massive and amorphous. Within the \nCharles Formation at 9,126\u2019 MD slower penetration rates indicated the presence of anhydrite.\n\nThis section was approximately 12\u2019 thick, its base, as indicated by the transition to faster \npenetration rates and higher gamma API counts is indicative of the Upper Berentson which was \ndrilled at 9,138' MD 9,136' TVD (-7,017') SS. \n \nThe Ratcliffe interval [Charles Formation] was drilled at 9,264' MD 9,262' TVD (-7,143') SS. \nThe top of this interval was observed as faster penetration rates were encountered, as the well \nbore transitioned from anhydrite to limestone mudstone. This limestone was tan to light brown, \noccasional light gray tan, rare off white lime mudstone. This facies was microcrystalline, firm,  \nwith an earthy and crystalline texture and contained a trace of disseminated pyrite. Also noted in \ncertain areas was a trace light brown oil stain; possible earthy to intercrystalline porosity may \nhave been present \n \nThe Mission Canyon Formation [Mississippian Madison Group] was logged at 9,444' MD 9,442' \nTVD (-7,323') SS. The Mission Canyon Formation consisted of lime mudstone that was \ndescribed as light gray, light gray brown, light brown to brown, gray brown, rare off white, trace \ngray in color. The microcrystalline was predominately friable to firm, dense with an earthy to \ncrystalline texture. Some intervals were trace siliceous with traces of disseminated pyrite. Fossil \nfragments, along with black, dark brown algal laminations were visible in some samples \nthroughout the Mission Canyon Formation. Following connections or downtime (periods of non-\ncirculation), gas shows of 27 to 37 units were noted A trace to rare spotty light brown and dark \nbrown dead spotty oil stain was occasionally observed while logging the Mission Canyon \nFormation. \n \n \n \nFigure 4. Limestone with spotty light brown and dead dark brown oil staining from the Mission Canyon \nFormation. \n \nThe Lodgepole Formation [Mississippian Madison Group] was encountered at 10,003' MD \n10,001' TVD (-7,882\u2019) SS. This interval was characterized by medium to light gray, occasional \nmedium gray tan, rare dark gray, trace light gray brown, trace black gray, argillaceous lime \nmudstone which was evidenced by the elevated gamma. The lithology was further characterized \nas being microcrystalline, firm, and dense, with an earthy texture. Also present in certain areas \nwere traces of algal laminations and fossil fragments. Disseminated pyrite was also seen in the \nsamples as a trace mineral. No significant gas shows were noted in this formation.\n\nThe \u201cFalse Bakken\u201d [Lodgepole Formation] was drilled at 10,749' MD 10,697' TVD (-8,578') \nSS, and the Scallion limestone at 10,752' MD 10,700\u2019 TVD (-8,581') SS. Samples from the False \nBakken are typically brown, black, shale, friable, subblocky with an earthy texture. This facies is \ncalcareous, with traces of disseminated pyrite. Gas levels were slightly elevated through this \ninterval with a maximum connection gas of 748 units likely due to fracture porosity.  \n \nThe Upper Bakken Shale Member [Mississippian-Bakken Formation] was drilled at 10,765' MD \n10,709' TVD (-8,590') SS. Entry into this member was characterized by high gamma, elevated \nbackground gas and increased rates of penetration. The black carbonaceous and petroliferous \nshale was sub blocky and firm with an earthy texture.  Trace minerals were observed to include \ndisseminated pyrite and calcite fracture fill, representing possible fracture porosity. \nHydrocarbons evaluated in this interval reached a maximum of 916 units. \n \nThe Bakken Middle Member [Mississippian-Devonian] was reached at 10,793' MD 10, 724' \nTVD (-8,605') SS. This formation was predominantly siltstone and silty sandstone noted by the \ndecreasing penetration rates, gamma API counts, and recorded gas levels, relative to the \noverlying source rock. The siltstone was light gray, light gray brown, sub-blocky, with an earthy \ntexture. It was moderately calcite cemented, with a trace of disseminated pyrite. Also present \nwas silty sandstone which was light gray, light brown, light gray brown, friable, very fine \ngrained, well sorted, friable, sub-angular to sub-round, and contained possible intergranular \nporosity. It was moderately calcite cemented. Trace minerals included disseminated and nodular \npyrite. Drilling gas in this interval reached a maximum of 154 units. Also observed was spotty \nlight brown spotty oil stain.  \n \nThe Lower Bakken Shale Member [Devonian] was reached at 10,885' MD 10,767' TVD (-8,648') \nSS. This was 6\u2019 to the Lindvig 1-11-3C. Entry into this interval was characterized by high \ngamma, elevated background gas and increased rates of penetration. The carbonaceous black \nshale is petroliferous, with an earthy texture and exhibits possible fracture porosity. Trace \nminerals included disseminated pyrite. Drilling gas in this interval reached a maximum of 135 \nunits with a connection gas of 158 units. \n  \n \n \nFigure 5. Sample of gray siltstone from the Pronghorn Member.\n\nThe Pronghorn Member [Devonian-Bakken Formation] was reached at 10,917' MD 10,775' TVD \n(-8,656') SS. Entry into this interval was characterized by lower gamma, and slightly slower \npenetration rates. Samples from the Pronghorn were described as a siltstone which was medium \nto dark gray, friable, sub-platy to sub-blocky, with an earthy texture. The siltstone was \nmoderately dolomite cemented and included disseminated and nodular pyrite. Drilling gas in this \ninterval reached a maximum of 91 units with a connection gas of 142 units. \n \nThe Three Forks Formation [Devonian] was reached at 10,995' MD 10,794' TVD (-8,675') SS. \nThe target zone of the Three Forks was to be drilled in the dolomitic facies in a ten foot zone \nbeginning 8 feet into the Three Forks Formation. This target zone was later revised to an 8 foot \ndrilling zone located sixteen feet into the Three Forks Formation. The revised plan was \nimplemented to avoid deflections from multiple tight streaks located high in formation, and to \ntake advantage of the low gamma primarily dolomitic facies, which proved useful for steering \ndecisions.  \n \n  \n \n \nFigure 6.  Sample of the predominately dolomitic facies in the updated preferred drilling zone of the Three \nForks formation on left; sample of the underlying claystone on the right.  \n  \nSamples in the Three Forks were commonly dolomite which was tan to light brown, occasional \nmedium brown, occasional off white to cream. Additionally this facies was friable with an earthy \ntexture. It also contained a trace of disseminated and nodular pyrite. Possible intercrystalline \nporosity was observed, as was a rare to a trace of light brown spotty oil stain. Present in varying \namounts was light gray, off white, rare light green to mint green shale which was friable to firm, \nsub-blocky with an earthy texture. Trace of nodular and disseminated pyrite was noted, and the \nshale contained no visible porosity. \n \nGas Show  \n \nGas monitoring and fluid gains provided evidence of a hydrocarbon saturated reservoir during \nthe drilling of the Yukon 5301 41-12T. Oil and gas shows at the shakers and in samples were \ncontinuously monitored. In the closed mud system, hydrostatic conditions were maintained near \nbalance, this allowed for gas and fluid gains from the well to be evaluated. Gas on the Yukon \n5301 41-12T varied according to penetration rates and stratigraphic position. Background \nconcentrations ranged from 150 to 250 units, and connection peaks of 300 to 500 units were\n\nobserved in the middle portion of formation while drilling in the lateral where shows were the \nbest. Trips at 13,675\u2019 MD, 16,506\u2019 MD, 19,671\u2019 MD, and 20,265\u2019 MD, yielded trip gases of \n2,256, 5,778, 6,745, and 2,423 units respectively. Chromatography of gas revealed typical \nconcentrations of methane, ethane, propane and butane characteristic of Bakken and Three Forks \ngas (Figure 7).   \n \n \n \nFigure 7.

Profile displaying total gas, gamma ray and rate of penetration.\n\nGeo-steering \n \nGeologic structure maps of the Yukon 5301 41-12T and surrounding control wells, estimated \nformational dip to move down at approximately -0.3\u00ba initially, then reverse due to a plunging \nsyncline at about 2,500\u2019, reversing to an estimated 0.5\u00ba  to 1.0\u00ba  until total depth (TD) was \nreached.  The Yukon 5301 41-12T preferred drilling interval consisted of a ten foot zone located \napproximately eight feet into the Three Forks Formation. Stratigraphic position in the target zone \nwas based on penetration rates, gas shows, gamma ray data and sample observations. The \nprojected target landing was to be ten feet into the Three Forks and was successfully reached \nprior to casing operations. Using offsets provided by Oasis representatives, projected porosity \nzones were identified as the preferred drilling areas (Figure 9).  \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 9.  Type log gamma profile from the Lindvig 1-11-3C, with initial target points on top and revised tops \non bottom.  \n \nAs the well bore moved from the top to the bottom of the preferred drilling zone, gamma API \ncounts, collected samples, and gas were evaluated along with penetration rates to identify areas \nwithin the 10\u2019 preferred drilling zone that yielded the best potential.\n\nAfter exiting intermediate casing the well-bore onsite personnel attempted to steer the well-bore \ndown to the low gamma portion of the drilling zone to attempt to establish dip. After multiple \nencounters with tight streaks which moved the well-bore\u2019s inclination above 90 degrees the \ndirectional drillers were able to position the well-bore in the lower gamma area of the drilling \nzone.  At this point the target zone was revised to an 8 foot drilling zone located sixteen feet into \nthe Three Forks Formation. The revised plan was implemented to avoid deflections from \nmultiple tight streaks located high in formation, and to take advantage of the low gamma \nprimarily dolomitic facies which proved useful for steering decisions. Steering decisions from \nthis point were made by using the higher gamma, of the claystone, the low gamma located in the \nmiddle to higher portion of the drilling zone, and the fluctuating high to medium gamma located \nat the top of the drilling zone.  \n \nAt 20,573\u2019 MD while taking a check shot to determine the well-bore inclination, spiking \ndifferential pressure shut down the pumps. It was determined that the well-bore had entered the \npronghorn formation at 20,530\u2019 MD, which was causing the hole to pack off. Working the pipe \nand pumping cleared the hole enough to take a survey at 20,573\u2019 MD with a survey depth of \n20,520\u2019, which showed an inclination of 91.5\u00ba. A previous check shot at 20,535\u2019 MD and a \nsurvey depth of 20,482\u2019 showed an inclination of 90.5\u00ba; a difference of 1\u00ba change in inclination \nover 38\u2019 while rotating. This illustrates one of the problems encountered in the later portion of \nthe lateral. Despite multiple down side slides, the well-bore showed a persistent tendency to \nbuild rapidly on rotation. Onsite personnel at this time were plotting the formation inclination at \n0.61\u00ba up, which had been recently revised from a 1.12\u00ba up dip. The data from the pronghorn \nstrike when plotted with previous data determined that the formation had unexpectedly rolled \nover to a dip of 0.01. This unexpected dip change combined with the well-bores tendency to \nbuild on rotation, and the difficulty in sliding, and obtaining effective slides all contributed to the \npronghorn strike.  \n \nSamples tended to contain a greater quantity of the tan to cream, rare off white dolomite where \ngamma values were lower, and relatively a greater quantity of the blue green gray shale where \ngamma values were higher. Samples from the claystone contained a dolomite mudstone, which \nwas gray, tan to cream, with a trace of light gray, and a trace of off white. It was very fine \ncrystalline, friable, dense, with an earthy texture. Minerals present were rare disseminated pyrite, \nalong with a trace of nodular pyrite. Also noted was possible intercrystalline porosity, and \ncommon spotty light to medium brown oil stain. Also present in samples taken from the higher \ngamma claystone facies was shale. This shale was a light gray green to light gray, pale green \nwith a trace off white. This shale was firm, subblocky, with an earthy texture, along with a trace \ndisseminated pyrite.  No visible oil stain was noted in the observed shale. Where the low gamma \nwas encountered in the bottom of the target interval, thin layers of dolomite contained possible \nfair to good intercrystalline porosity and common spotty light to medium brown oil staining.  \n \nThe TD of 21,450\u2019 MD was achieved at 1550 hours CDT on July 16, 2013. The well site team \nworked well together maintaining the well bore in the desired target interval for 88% of the \nlateral, opening 10,225\u2019 of potentially productive reservoir rock. The hole was then circulated \nand reamed for completion.\n\nSUMMARY  \n \nThe Yukon 5301 41-12T is a successful well in Oasis Petroleum\u2019s horizontal Three Forks \ndevelopment program in Baker Field. The project was drilled from surface casing to TD in 19 \ndays. The TD of 21,220\u2019 MD was achieved at 1550 hours CDT July 16, 2013. The well site team \nworked well together maintaining the well bore in the desired target interval for 88% of the \nlateral, opening 10,225\u2019 of potentially productive reservoir rock. \n \nDiesel invert drilling fluid 9.6-10.2 ppg for the vertical hole and 10.3-10.55 ppg for curve \noperations were used to maintain stable hole conditions, minimize washout through the salt \nintervals and permit adequate analysis of mud gas concentrations.  \n \nSamples in the Three Forks were commonly dolomite which was tan to light brown, occasional \nmedium brown, occasional off white to cream. Additionally this facies was friable with an earthy \ntexture. It also contained a trace of disseminated and nodular pyrite. Possible intercrystalline \nporosity was observed, as was a rare to a trace of light brown spotty oil stain. Present in varying \namounts was light gray, off white, rare light green to mint green shale which was friable to firm, \nsub-blocky with an earthy texture. Trace of nodular and disseminated pyrite was noted, and the \nshale contained no visible porosity. \n \nSamples tended to contain a greater quantity of the tan to cream, rare off white dolomite where \ngamma values were lower, and relatively a greater quantity of the blue green gray shale where \ngamma values were higher. Where the low gamma was encountered in the bottom of the target \ninterval, thin layers of dolomite contained possible fair to good intercrystalline porosity and \ncommon spotty light to medium brown oil staining.  \n \nGas on the Yukon 5301 41-12T varied according to penetration rates and stratigraphic position \nof the well bore. Observed concentrations ranged from 150 to 250 units background, and \nconnection peaks of 300 to 500 units were observed in the middle portion of formation where \nshows were the best while drilling in the lateral. Trips at 13,675\u2019 MD, 16,506\u2019 MD, 19,671\u2019 MD, \nand 20,265\u2019 MD, yielded trip gases of 2,256, 5,778, 6,745, and 2,423 units respectively \n \nThe Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC. Yukon 5301 41-12T awaits completion operations to \ndetermine its ultimate production potential.  \n \nRespectfully submitted,  \n \nG. Wayne Peterson \nSunburst Consulting, Inc.  \n18 July, 2013"

The 7\" casing shoe is \nacross the hard line, but the perforations are not. \nAs a result of the likely case that there is not sufficient cement isolation across the hardline, Oasis Petroleum is \nrespectfully requesting permission to use the swellable packer configuration described above in order to achieve \nisolation prior to fracture stimulation. --. ~ \n; \ni s \nl tv\\. \nCompany \nrelephone Number \nOasis Petroleum North America LLC \n(281) 404-9634 \nAddress \n1001 Fannin, Suite 1500 \nCity \nI \nState \n'Zip Code \nHouston \n.. \nTX \n77002 \nSignature \n~ \nPrinted Name \nWuL \nMike Brown \nTitle \nDate \nDrilling Engineer II \nJuly 5, 2013 \nEmail Address \nmbrown@oasispetroleum.com"

The \napproval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than \nthe 200' setback from the north & south boundaries and 500' setback from the east & west boundaries within \nthe 1280 acre spacing unit consisting of Sections 1 & 12. Tool error is not required pursuant to order \n \nPERMIT STIPULATIONS: A Closed Mud System is required on multi-well pads, although the disposal \nof drill cuttings is contingent upon site specific conditions to be determined by an NDIC Field \nInspector.  A perimeter dike is required along the north & east sides of the location.  OASIS must \ncontact NDIC Field Inspector Marc Binns at 701-220-5989 prior to location construction. \n \nForm 1 Changes & Hard Lines  \n  Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.  \nThe proposed directional plan is at a legal location.  The maximum legal coordinate from the well head at casing \npoint is: 150W.   Also, based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum legal coordinate from the well \nhead is: 9952S & 150W. \n \nLocation Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period) \n   Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the \napproved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report.   If circumstances require operations to \ncommence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may \nbe waived by the Director.  Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information \nnecessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other \ninformation that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the \ndrilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit. \n \nPermit Fee & Notification \n   Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card .The permit fee has been received.  It is requested \nthat notification be given immediately upon the spudding of the well.  This information should be relayed to the \nOil & Gas Division, Bismarck, via telephone.  The following information must be included:  Well name, legal \nlocation, permit number, drilling contractor, company representative, date and time of spudding.  Office hours are \n8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is (701) 328-8020, leave a \nmessage if after hours or on the weekend.\n\nKaitlin Bass \nDecember 20, 2011 \nPage 2 \n \nSurvey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells \n   NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey contractor \nshall file a certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion.  Surveys \nmust be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director may \nrequire the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the \noperation of the director's office in a timely manner.  Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe \ndocument, with a certification cover page to certsurvey@nd.gov.    \nSurvey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.  \n \nReserve pit \n \nPlease be advised that conditions may be imposed on the use and reclamation of a drilling reserve pit on \nthis site if specific site conditions warrant. \n \nSurface casing cement \n \nTail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12 \nhours, and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi \nbefore drilling the plug or initiating tests.   \n \nLogs \n \nNDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of a Cement Bond Log from which the presence of \ncement can be determined in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set and a Gamma \nRay Log must be run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore.  All logs must be submitted as \none paper copy and one digital copy in LAS (Log ASCII) format, or a format approved by the Director.  Image \nlogs that include, but are not limited to, Mud Logs, Cement Bond Logs, and Cyberlook Logs, cannot be produced \nin their entirety as LAS (Log ASCII) files.  To create a solution and establish a standard format for industry to \nfollow when submitting image logs, the Director has given approval for the operator to submit an image log as a \nTIFF (*.tif) formatted file.  The TIFF (*.tif) format will be accepted only when the log cannot be produced in its \nentirety as a LAS (Log ASCII) file format. The digital copy may be submitted on a 3.5\u201d floppy diskette, a standard \nCD, or attached to an email sent to digitallogs@nd.gov    \nThank you for your cooperation.  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nSincerely,  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nTodd L.
