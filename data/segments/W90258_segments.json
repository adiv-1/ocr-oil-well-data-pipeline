Helms - Director\n| North Dakota Industrial Commission\n| Of AND_GAS DIVISION www.dmr.nd.gov/oilgas\u2019 G BSS\nMay 11. 2016\nRE: Saltwater Disposal Well Reporting and Monitoring Requirements\nDear Salnwater Disposal Operator:\n\nThis letter is to outline and clarify the Commission's requirements for monthly reporting and\nmonitoring of saltwater disposal wells which are outlined under North Dakota Administrative\nCode (NDAC) Section 43-02-05-12, and the type of wastes that can be injected pursuant to the\nEPA guidelines for Exempt and Non-Exempt Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Wastes.\n\nAll injection into a saltwater disposal well must be measured, either through a meter or by an\napproved method. Accurate gauges must be placed on the tubing and tubing-casing annulus of the\nwell for pressure monitoring. Any noncompliance with regulations or permit conditions must be\nreported io the Commission oraily within 24 hours followed by a written explanation within 5\ndays.\n\nMonthly reporting of the following information is required to be submitted for a saltwater\ndisposal well on a Saltwater Disposal Report (Form 16):\n\n1. Beginning and end of month meter readings\n\n2. Total barrels injected for the month.\n\n3. Average daily operating injection pressure (this means a typical pressure observed while\nthe well is injecting, not a mathematical average).\n\n4. Sources of received fluid (these sources need to be listed by well or facility name and\nnumber, NDIC well or facility file number, and the location of each source by\nquarter-quarter. section, township, and range).\n\n5. Amount of fluid received from each source,\n\n6. Nature of the received fluid (i.e. produced water, pit water, ete.).\n\n7. Transportation method used to transport the injection fluid to the disposal weil site (ie.\npipeline or truck).\n\nSaltwater Disposal Reports (Form 16) are due on or before the fifth day of the second month\nsucceeding the month in which the well is capable of disposal (i.e. January report due March 3th)\n\nPursuant to NDAC Section 43-02-05-13.1, all records from which to make and substantiate\nrequired reports shal] be kept for a period of not less than six years.\n\n600 E Boulevard Ave - Dept 405, Bismarck, North Dakota 58505-0840 Phone (701 )328-8020 Fax (701)328-8022\n\nMay 11, 2016\n\nSaltwater Disposal Well Reporting and Monitoring Requirements\n\nPage 2 of 2\n\nThe NDIC abides by the Environmental Protection Agency guidelines for Exempt and\nNon-Exempt Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Wastes to determine what wastes can be\naccepted for disposal from oil and gas exploration and production operations. Attached is an\nexample list of exempt and non-exempt oil and gas exploration and production wastes along with a\nflow chart for determining the status of a waste.\n\nThe operator is only authorized to inject Class II fluids into a saltwater disposal well. Class\nIl fluids are generally defined as follows:\n\n1. Produced water from oil and gas production.\n\n2. Waste fluids from actual drilling operations.\n\n3. Used workover, completion, and stimulation fluids recovered from production, injection,\n\nand exploratory wells.\n\n4. Waste fluids from circulation during well cementing.\n\n5. Pigging fluids from cleaning of collection and injection lines within the field.\n\n6. Enhanced recovery waters including fresh water makeup and other waters containing\n\nchemicals for the purpose of enhanced recovery.\n\n7. Gases used for enhanced recovery/pressure maintenance of production reservoirs.\n\n8. Brine reject from water softeners associated with enhanced recovery.\n\n9. Waste oil and fluids from clean up within the oil field.\n\n10. Waste water from gas plants which are an integral part of production operations unless\n\nthose waters are classified as hazardous waste at the time of injection.\n\nThe following fluids are non-exempt fluids and are not authorized to be injected into a Class\nIl saltwater disposal well:\n\n1. Unused fracturing fluids or acids.\n\n2. Vacuum truck and drum rinsate from trucks and drums containing non-exempt waste.\n\n3. Refined gasoline or diesel fuels.\n\n4. Used equipment lubricating oils.\n\n5. Refinery wastes.\n\n6. Radioactive tracer wastes.\n\n7, Car wash wastes.\n\nPlease distribute this letter and the attachment to the appropriate personnel responsible for\nreporting on and monitoring each saltwater disposal well your company operates. If you have any\nquestions, do not hesitate to contact me.\n\nSincerely,\nAshleigh Day\nUnderground Injection Supervisor"
