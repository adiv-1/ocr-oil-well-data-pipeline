This \nsection lies approximately 7 miles south of the town of Williston and adjacent to Lake \nSakakawea in McKenzie County. The  Kline Federal 5300 31-18 15T is a horizontal First Bench \nThree Forks well, in a double-section, laydown spacing unit permitted to drill to the east  from \nthe surface location within Section 18, continuing through Section 17 to the proposed bottom-\nhole location (PBHL) in that section. There are 200\u2019 setbacks along the north and south borders \nand 500\u2019 setbacks from the east and west borders within the 1,280 acre spacing unit. The well \nconsists of one Three Forks lateral. The vertical hole was planned to be drilled to approximately \n10,293\u2019. The curve would be built at 12 degrees per 100\u2019 to land within the First Bench Three \nForks. Directional drilling technologies and geo-steering techniques were used to land in the \nThree Forks reservoir and maintain exposure to the ideal target rock.  Oasis Petroleum is \ntargeting a dolomite shale facies of the Three Forks Formation with intent to intersect porosity \nand fracture trends enhancing reservoir quality.\n\nOFFSET WELLS  \n \nOffset well data used for depth correlation during curve operations are found in the \u2018Control \nData\u2019 section appended to this report. Offset well control was essential in providing control data, \nmaking it possible to develop a prognosis of formation tops and landing target depth. By \nreferencing the gamma signature of these offsets, a model was formed for the target interval \npinpointing a strategic landing.  Formation thicknesses expressed by gamma ray signatures in \nthese wells were compared to gamma data collected during drilling operations in order to \nsuccessfully land the curve. The target landing true vertical depth (TVD) was periodically \nupdated during drilling to ensure accurate landing of the curve.  \n \nGEOLOGY \n \nThe Mission Canyon Formation [Mississippian Madison Group] was logged 9,391' MD 9,390' \nTVD (-7,357' SS). The Mission Canyon Formation consisted of a lime mudstone that was \ndescribed as light gray, light brown to brown, gray brown, trace dark gray in color. The lime \nmudstone was predominately friable to firm, with an earthy to rare crystalline texture. Some \nintervals contained a trace of black-brown algal material, traces of fossil fragments, and traces of \ndisseminated pyrite. Also present was an argillaceous lime mudstone that was described as light \ngray, occasional medium gray, rare gray tan, rare off white, trace dark gray in color. The \nargillaceous lime mudstone was predominately firm to friable, crystalline to chalky texture. \nSome intervals contained a trace of disseminated pyrite. The highest gas shows were 71 to 112 \nunits and 53 units of connection gas in the Mission Canyon. Rare intercrystalline porosity was \nnoted as well as trace spotty light brown oil stain while logging the Mission Canyon Formation. \n                              \nThe Upper Bakken Shale Member [Mississippian-Bakken Formation] was drilled at 10,737' MD \n10,671' TVD (-8,638' SS). Entry into this member was characterized by high gamma, elevated \nbackground gas and increased rates of penetration. The black to black gray carbonaceous and \npetroliferous shale was hard with a sub blocky to sub platy texture. Fracture porosity was noted, \nand trace minerals were observed including disseminated pyrite and calcite fracture fill. \nHydrocarbons evaluated in this interval reached a maximum of 367 units of drilling gas. \n                                                                               \nThe Middle Bakken Member [Mississippian-Devonian Bakken Formation] was drilled at 10,766' \nMD 10,687' TVD (-8,654' SS) which was 9\u2019 high to the Oasis Petroleum North America LLC \nChalmers 5300 21-19 8T. Samples in the Middle Bakken Member were predominantly silty \nsandstone which was described as light gray brown, light brown, trace light gray in color. It was \nvery fine grained, friable, subrounded, smooth, moderately sorted, and moderately calcite \ncemented. A trace of disseminated and nodular pyrite was noted as was fair intergranular \nporosity. Also noted was common light to medium brown spotty to even oil stain. Hydrocarbons \nevaluated in this interval reached a maximum of 292 units of drilling gas. \n \nThe Lower Bakken Shale Member [Mississippian-Bakken Formation] was drilled at 10,850' MD \n10,729' TVD (-8,696' SS). Entry into this interval was characterized by high gamma, elevated \nbackground gas and increased rates of penetration. The carbonaceous black, black gray shale is \npetroliferous, hard, splintery, smooth and exhibits possible fracture porosity. Trace minerals \nincluded disseminated pyrite. Drilling gas in this interval reached a maximum of 339 units.\n\nThe Pronghorn Member [Devonian-Bakken Formation] was reached at 10,876' MD 10,740' TVD \n(-8,707' SS). Entry into this interval was characterized by lower gamma, and slightly slower \npenetration rates. Samples from the Pronghorn were described as siltstone which was dark gray \ntrace gray black and friable to firm. This siltstone was moderately dolomite cemented and \nincluded disseminated and nodular pyrite. Also noted was a trace of spotty light brown oil stain. \nDrilling gas in this interval reached a maximum of 250 units. \n \nThe Three Forks [Devonian] was reached at 10,916' MD 10,754' TVD (-8,721' SS) which was -\n16\u2019 high to the Oasis Petroleum North America LLC Chalmers 5300 21-19 8T. The target zone \nof the Three Forks was to be drilled in a predominately 16 foot zone beginning 12 feet into the \nThree Forks and representing the 1st Bench. \n \nSamples in the Three Forks were predominantly dolomite which was described as light brown-\nlight brown gray, tan-cream, trace pink in color. It was firm, laminated, with a microsucrosic \ntexture. Rare disseminated pyrite was noted as was occasional intercrystalline porosity. Also \nnoted was common spotty to rare even light brown oil stain. Also observed was light green-light \ngray green, mint green shale that was firm, sub blocky, with an earthy texture. Occasional \ndisseminated pyrite was noted as was possible intergranular porosity.      \n \n              \n \nDry sample of predominantly dolomite and shale from the Three Forks 1st Bench target zone.\n\nHydrocarbon Shows  \n \nGas monitoring and fluid gains provided evidence of a hydrocarbon saturated reservoir during \nthe drilling of the Kline Federal 5300 31-18 15T. Oil and gas shows at the shakers and in \nsamples were continuously monitored. In the closed mud system, hydrostatic conditions were \nmaintained near balance, this allowed for gas and fluid gains from the well to be evaluated. Gas \nvaried according to stratigraphic position and penetration rates which may have reflected \nincreased porosity. During the vertical, gas peaks of 42 to 301 units were noted, against a 9.7-\n10.4 ppg diesel-invert mud weight. Background concentrations in the lateral ranged from 132 to \n1,895 units, against a 9.6-9.65 lb/gal saltwater gel drilling fluid. Chromatography of gas revealed \ntypical concentrations of methane, characteristic of First Bench Three Forks gas.   \n \n \n \n \n Profile displaying trends in total gas, gamma ray and rate of penetration.  \n \nGeosteering \n \nRyan Energy Technologies provided personnel and equipment for measurement-while-drilling \n(MWD) services. The RPM directional drillers, MWD, and Sunburst Consulting personnel \nworked closely together throughout the project to evaluate data and make steering decisions to \nmaximize the amount of borehole in the targeted zones and increase rate of penetration (ROP) of \nthe formation.  \n \n0\n200\n400\n600\n800\n1000\n1200\n1400\n1600\n1800\n2000\n10740\n10750\n10760\n10770\n10780\n10790\n10800\n10810\n10820\n10830\n10840\n10850\n10860\n10870\n10700\n10900\n11100\n11300\n11500\n11700\n11900\n12100\n12300\n12500\n12700\n12900\n13100\n13300\n13500\n13700\n13900\n14100\n14300\n14500\n14700\n14900\n15100\n15300\n15500\n15700\n15900\n16100\n16300\n16500\n16700\n16900\n17100\n17300\n17500\n17700\n17900\n18100\n18300\n18500\n18700\n18900\n19100\n19300\n19500\n19700\n19900\n20100\n20300\n20500\nWellbore\nPronghorn\nTarget top\nBase Dolo/Sh Facies\nClaystone\nTG\nROP x 50\nGR x 5\nTotal Gas, ROP x 100, Gamma Ray x 10\nPROFILE\nW\nE\nMeasured Depth\nDepth (TVD)\nOasis Petroleum North America LLC\nKline Federal 5300 31-18 15T\nLot 3 Sec. 18, T153N, R100W\nMcKenzie County, ND\nGross apparent dip = -0.03\u00b0\nWt: 9.65\nVis: 29\nWt: 9.65\nVis: 29\nWt: 9.65\nVis: 29\nWt: 9.6\nVis: 29\n\nThe 920\u2019 curve was drilled in 24 hours, circulating time. The assembly used to complete the \ncurve consisted of bit #5; a Security MMD55M PDC bit, attached to a 2.38 degree fixed NOV \nstage 7/8 5.0 motor and MWD tools. The curve was successfully landed at 11,120\u2019 MD and \n10,772\u2019 TVD, approximately 18\u2019 into the Three Forks. Seven inch diameter 32# HCP-110 \nintermediate casing was set to 11,095\u2019 MD.  \n \nGeologic structure maps of the Kline Federal 5300 31-18 15T and surrounding control wells had \nestimated gross formation dip to be down at approximately 0.2\u00ba. The preferred drilling interval \nconsisted of a thirteen foot zone of dolomite and shale and a 3\u2019 zone of Claystone located \napproximately twelve feet into the Three Forks. Penetration rates, gas shows, gamma ray data, \nand sample observations were utilized to keep the wellbore in the preferred stratigraphic position \nin the target zone. Using offset well data provided by Oasis representatives, projected porosity \nzones were identified in the preferred drilling areas.  \n \n \n \n Offset well target definition for the Three Forks 1st Bench, Indian Hills Prospect (Oasis).   \n \nSteering decisions were made by using the low gamma in the lower portion of the target zone to \nestablish the well-bore\u2019s position in the target zone. If the well-bore moved lower, the higher \ngamma of the underlying claystone (G) was observed, as was the presence of claystone in \ncollected samples. Slides were then utilized to move the well-bore back up into the target zone. \nAs the well-bore moved higher, approaching the top of the target zone the high to medium \nfluctuating gamma (D) was noted. Samples in the lower gamma portion of the target zone \ncontained noticeably greater concentrations of the light brown-light brown gray, tan-cream, trace \npink dolomite; as the well-bore moved higher in zone the samples tended to have more of the \nlight gray, off white, gray brown dolomite. This lateral was drilled in 4 and a half days from \ncasing exit to TD, with two lateral assemblies. The TD of 20,542\u2019 MD was achieved at 17:15 \nhours CDT May 7, 2015. The wellbore was completed with 100% of the lateral in target,\n\nopening 9,447\u2019 (measurement taken from uncased lateral portion) of potentially productive \nreservoir rock. The hole was then circulated and reamed for completion. \n \nSUMMARY  \n \nThe Kline Federal 5300 31-18 15T is a successful well in Oasis Petroleum\u2019s horizontal 1st Bench \nThree Forks development program in Baker Field. The project was drilled from surface casing to \nTD in a little over 17 days. The TD of 20,542\u2019 MD was achieved at 17:15 hours CDT May 7, \n2015. The well site team worked together to maintain the well bore in the desired target interval \nfor 100% of the lateral, opening 9,447\u2019 of potentially productive reservoir rock.  \n \nSamples in the First Bench Three Forks were predominantly dolomite which was described as \nlight brown-light brown gray, tan-cream, trace pink in color. It was firm, laminated, with a \nmicrosucrosic texture. Rare disseminated pyrite was noted as was occasional intercrystalline \nporosity. Also noted was common spotty to rare even light brown oil stain. Also observed was \nlight green-light gray green, mint green shale that was firm, sub blocky, with an earthy texture. \nOccasional disseminated pyrite was noted as was possible intergranular porosity.      \n \nGas on the Kline Federal 5300 31-18 15T varied according to stratigraphic position and \npenetration rates which may have reflected increased porosity. The overall gas and hydrocarbon \nshows were encouraging and indicate a hydrocarbon rich system in the Three Forks. \n \nThe Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC. Kline Federal 5300 31-18 15T awaits completion \noperations to determine its ultimate production potential.  \n \nRespectfully submitted,  \n \nMichelle R.

OPNA Intends to drill the surface hole with freshwater based drilling mud \nand set surface casing with a small drilling rig and move off within 3 to 5 days. The casing will be set at a depth \npre-approved by the NDIC per the Application for Permit to Drill NDAC 43-02-03-21. No saltwater will be used In the \ndrilling and cementing operations of the surface casing. Once the surface casing is cemented, a plug or mechanical \nseal will be placed at the top of the casing to prevent any foreign matter from getting into the well. A rig capable of \ndrilling to TD will move onto the location within the 90 days previously outlined to complete the drilling and casing \nplan as per the APO. The undersigned states that this request for suspension of drilling operations In accordance \nwith the Subsection 4 of Section 43-02-03\u00b755 of the NDAC, Is being requested to take advantage of the cost savings \nand time savings of using an Initial rig that Is smaller than the rig necessary to drill a well to total depth but is not \nIntended to alter or extend the terms and conditions of, or suspend any obligation under, any oil and gas lease with \nacreage in or under the spacing or drilling unit for the above-referenced well. OPNA understands NDAC 43-02-03\u00b731 \nrequirements regarding confidentiality pertaining to this permit. The drilling pit will be fenced immediately, as site \nconditions allow, after construction if the well pad Is located in a pasture (NDAC 43-02-03-19 & 19.1 ). OPNA will \nnotify the NDIC and work on an alternative solution if unforeseen circumstances prevent the rig from returning to \ndrill prior to the 90 extension expiration. \nCompany \nOasis Petroleum North America LLC \nAddress \n1001 Fannin, Suite 1500 \nCity \nHouston \nSignature \nEmail Address \nPrinted Name \nState \nTX \nZip Code \n77002 \nVictoria Siemienlewski \nDate \nFebrua \n5, 2015 \n33 \nFOR STATE USE ONLY \nD Received \n00 Approved \nDate \nBy \nTille \nEngineering Technician"

The \napproval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than \nthe 500' setback from the north & south boundaries and 200' setback from the east & west boundaries within the \n1280 acre spacing unit consisting of Sections 17 & 18 T153N R100W.  \n \nPERMIT STIPULATIONS: Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for \nfilter sock disposal must be maintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, and must \nremain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations are \nconducted.  OASIS PETRO NO AMER must contact NDIC Field Inspector Richard Dunn at 701-770-\n3554 prior to location construction.  Due to surficial water adjacent to the well site, a dike is required \nsurrounding the entire location. \n \nDrilling pit \nNDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that \u201ca pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well \ndrilling and completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will \nprevent pollution of the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits \nare prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized representative of the director prior to lining and use.  \nDrill cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings \npit.\u201d \n \nForm 1 Changes & Hard Lines  \n  Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.  \nThe proposed directional plan is at a legal location.  Based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum \nlegal coordinate from the well head is: 10108 E. \n \nLocation Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period) \n   Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the \napproved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report.   If circumstances require operations to \ncommence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may \nbe waived by the Director.  Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information \nnecessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other \ninformation that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the \ndrilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit.\n\nVictoria Siemieniewski \nFebruary 25, 2015 \nPage 2 \n \nPermit Fee & Notification \n   Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card .The permit fee has been received.  It is requested \nthat notification be given immediately upon the spudding of the well.  This information should be relayed to the \nOil & Gas Division, Bismarck, via telephone.  The following information must be included:  Well name, legal \nlocation, permit number, drilling contractor, company representative, date and time of spudding.  Office hours are \n8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is (701) 328-8020, leave a \nmessage if after hours or on the weekend.  \n \nSurvey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells \n   NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey contractor \nshall file a certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion.  Surveys \nmust be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director may \nrequire the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the \noperation of the director's office in a timely manner.  Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe \ndocument, with a certification cover page to certsurvey@nd.gov.    \nSurvey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.  \nSpecifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve \n(or when sliding) and 90 feet in the lateral. \n \nSurface casing cement \n \nTail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12 \nhours, and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi \nbefore drilling the plug or initiating tests.   \n \nLogs \n \nNDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of (1) a suite of open hole logs from which formation tops and \nporosity zones can be determined, (2) a Gamma Ray Log run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore, and \n(3) a log from which the presence and quality of cement can be determined (Standard CBL or Ultrasonic cement evaluation \nlog) in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set, this log must be run prior to completing the well.  \nAll logs run must be submitted free of charge, as one digital TIFF (tagged image file format) copy and one digital LAS (log \nASCII) formatted copy. Digital logs may be submitted on a standard CD, DVD, or attached to an email sent to \ndigitallogs@nd.gov \n   \nThank you for your cooperation.  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nSincerely,

The Commission is very \nconcerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry. \n \nEffective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the \nwell is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations \nare conducted.  The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an \nauthorized facility.  Such containers must be: \n\uf0b7 \nleakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container \n\uf0b7 \ncovered to prevent precipitation from entering the container \n\uf0b7 \nplacard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container \n \nIf the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but \nonly upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request. \n \nAs previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01 \nstates in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production \nwastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste \nManagement.  Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the \nsolid waste program.  Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud, \ninvert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.  \n \nThank you for your cooperation.  \n \n \n \nSincerely, \n \n \n \nBruce E.
