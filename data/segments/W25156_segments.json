Any such well must be plugged and\nthe site reclaimed.\nPlease place this well back into production or submit for approval plug and abandonment\nprocedures. If the well is to be utilized in the future, a temporarily abandoned status may be\ngranted, provided it can be demonstrated that the well is to be used for purposes related to the\nproduction of oil and gas. The temporarily abandoned status is for one year, with extensions\nupon application. Before a well is granted a temporarily abandoned status, the perforations\nmust be isolated, the integrity of the casing proven, and its casing scaled at the surface, all in\na manner approved by the director. A state field inspector must witness the mechanical\nintegrity test.

Columbus Federal 1-16H, SHL: 2593\u2019 FSL 318\u2019 FEL, S16 \nT153N R101W is located approximately 2 miles west and 7 miles South of Williston, North \nDakota just south of the Missouri River. The Columbus Federal 1-16H is a horizontal well in \nthe Baker Field drilling under the Lewis and Clark State Wildlife Management Area.  The well \nwas planned for one 9951\u2019 long northerly transect drilled structurally up dip in the middle \nmember of the Bakken Formation.  The terminus of the lateral bore was expected to be 15\u2019 \nTVD higher than the landing point of the curve.   \nThe geological objective was to remain in the 10\u2019 thick Target Zone of the Middle Bakken, \nstratigraphically situated from 15\u2019 to 25\u2019 beneath the base of the Upper Bakken Shale.  The \ndrilling plan included a vertical hole to be drilled to MD 2674\u2019, then hold an inclination of 19.02\u00b0 \nwith and azimuth of 333.85\u00b0 until kick-off point was reached in the Lodgepole Formation at MD \n10594\u2019. Directional tools were utilized to build a curve and land within the legal setbacks of \nSection 9 in the middle member of the Bakken Formation. 7\u201d intermediate casing was run to \nMD 11371\u2019, TVD 10532\u2019, 231' FSL 1742' FEL in S9 T153N R101W.  A single 6\u201d horizontal \nlateral was then drilled along a 333.85\u00b0 azimuth and a turn to 0.0\u00b0 at MD 12277\u2019, with a \nprojected bottom hole termination at MD 21356\u2019, TVD 10522\u2019, 200\u2019 FNL  1980\u2019 FEL in S4  \nT153N  R100W. \nOFFSET INFORMATION  \nControl for developing a prognosis of formation tops and in determining a structure model for \nthe target zone along the course of the lateral was obtained from the Continental Resources \nregional structural mapping and the #1 Mildred and the #1 FLB Morris 11-23 wells noted on \nthe figure below.  Formation tops and structural relationships between the control wells and the \nColumbus Federal 1-16H are shown in the table below.  \nDRILLING OPERATIONS \nVertical and Curve \nPatterson 490 spudded the Columbus Federal 1-16H on April 22, 2013.  A 13 5/8\" hole was \ndrilled with fresh water to 1947\u2019, isolated with 9 5/8\" 36# J55 STC casing, and cemented to \nsurface. After surface casing operations were concluded, drilling fluid was changed to diesel \ninvert for the remaining vertical hole and curve build sections. An 8 \u00be\u201d PDC and mud motor \nwas used to drill out of the surface casing to kickoff point at MD 10563\u2019. Directional tools \nemploying a Leam 2.25 bent assembly and a Security FXD55M to land the build curve at MD \n11401\u2019 TVD 10532\u2019 with a projected inclination of 90.90\u00ba.  7\", 26#, 29#, & 32# HCP-110, LTC \nintermediate casing was then run to MD 11371\u2019 and cemented.  \n \nLateral \nDiesel invert mud used while drilling the vertical and curve portions of the hole was replaced \nwith 9.7 to 9.95 # sodium chloride brine for the remainder of drilling operations. A Security \nFX64 6\u201d bit and 1.5 Deg. steerable motor assembly was used to drill the lateral section.\n\n6 \nWELLSITE LOCATION MAP \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGEOLOGICAL EVALUATION  \nWell site geological supervision of Columbus 1-16H was provided by Monaco Services, Inc., \nwith one wellsite geologist and one mudlogger. Monaco personnel obtained gas   \nquantification utilizing a Bloodhound unit 0585 and a MSI 2100 gas extractor. WITS \ninformation was imported from the drilling rig Pason EDR system. Rig crews caught lagged 30\u2019 \nsamples from MD 8600\u2019 to 11400\u2019 and 50\u2019 samples from 11450\u2019 to TD at  MD 21276\u2019.  \nSamples were examined microscopically with plain and UV light as caught.  \n#1 MILDRED \n#1 FLB MORRIS 11-23\n\n7 \nLITHOLOGY AND HYDROCARBON SHOWS  \nVertical and Curve \nGeologic evaluation began at 8600\u2019 above the Charles Formation. The Top of the Charles \nwas encountered at MD 8660\u2019 TVD 8320\u2019 (-6379\u2019), 13\u2019 structurally higher than the prognosis.  \nThe Base of the Last Charles Salt was encountered at MD 9417\u2019 TVD 9040\u2019 (-7099\u2019), 9\u2019 \nstructurally lower than the prognosis and 46\u2019 lower than the nearest Control well, the #1 \nMildred.  While drilling through the Ratcliffe Interval, trace pinpoint vuggy porosity with a trace \nof black hydrocarbon stain was observed.  Gas increased from 160 units to 214 units and a \nfaint slow milky yellow cut was also observed.   \nThe top of the Mission Canyon Formation was encountered at MD 9628\u2019 TVD 9246\u2019 (-7305\u2019), \n9\u2019 high to the prognosis and 40\u2019 structurally low to the #1 Mildred.  Shows were observed at \nMD10020\u2019 TVD 9614\u2019 (-7673), gas increased from 265 units to 586\u2019.  Samples had a trace \nshow and consisted of WACKESTONE:  cream to very light brown mottled firm \nmicrocrystalline porosity trace asphaltic staining faint slow milky yellow cut.  \nThe Lodgepole Formation was observed at MD 10210\u2019 TVD 9793\u2019 (-7852\u2019), 28\u2019 high to the \nprognosis and 8\u2019 structurally low to the #1 Mildred and the well was \u201ckicked-off\u201d at 10562\u2019.  \nFive gamma markers were selected and used to calculate the landing point while drilling \nthrough the formation.  The \u201cFalse Bakken\u201d was observed at MD 11104\u2019 TVD 10501\u2019 (-8560\u2019).  \nTotal gas increased from 300 units to 400 units while in this interval   The Scallion Zone was \nobserved to exist between MD 11108\u2019 and 11136\u2019, samples had a good show and consisted of  \nMUDSTONE  light gray subhard dense microcrystalline no visible porosity very pale yellow \nfluorescence slow faint milky pale yellow cut.  Due to possible fracturing, total gas shot up \nimmediately from 340 units to over 2500 units while drilling through the Scallion Interval with \nthe chromatograms indicating the presence of oil with a change in gas composition. \nThe Bakken Formation Upper Shale was encountered at MD 11142\u2019 TVD 10509\u2019 (-8568\u2019), 1\u2019 \nhigh to the prognosis and 3\u2019 structurally low to the #1 Mildred.  Samples consisted of \nCARBONACEOUS SHALE black to very dark graybrown firm blocky brittle non-calcareous \nnon-fluorescent slow milky to streaming pale yellow cut. Total gas in the Bakken Formation \nUpper Shale ranged between 460 to 1433 units. \nThe Middle Member of the Bakken Formation was encountered at MD 11215\u2019 TVD 10525\u2019      \n(-8584\u2019), 3\u2019 high to the prognosis and 3\u2019 structurally low to the #1 Mildred. Samples observed \nwhile drilling downward through the 15\u2019 of section above the top of the target zone consisted of  \nSILTACEOUS \nCALCAREOUS \nDOLOMITE- \nlight \nto \nmedium \ngray \ngraybrown \nfirm \nmicrocrystalline moderately argillaceous dolomitic pale yellow green fluorescence immediate \nmilky and slow streaming pale green cut, as well as SILTACEOUS CALCAREOUS \nDOLOMITE- light to medium gray graybrown firm microcrystalline moderately argillaceous \ndolomitic pale yellow green fluorescence immediate milky and slow streaming yellow green cut     \nThe first encounter with the top of the Target Zone was at MD 12093\u2019 TVD 10538\u2019 (-8597\u2019), \nand consisted of ARENACEOUS CALCAREOUS DOLOMITE- light gray brown sub-hard fine \ngrained moderately well sorted subangular sand grains in light gray moderately calcareous \ndolomitic cement trace intercrystalline porosity faint pale yellow fluorescence immediate milky \nyellow cut \nThe curve was landed in the Middle Member of the Bakken Formation at MD 11371\u2019 TVD \n10532\u2019 with a projected inclination of 90.57\u00b0.  The landing point of the curve was approximately \n7 vertical feet above the Top of the Target Zone.\n\n8 \nLateral Samples Shows  \n Samples observed along the course of the lateral when the well path was in the Target was \nArenaceous Dolomite. Gamma values observed while drilling through the target varied from 42 \nto 72 API. Samples from directly above the top of the Target Zone consisted of SILTACEOUS \nCALCAREOUS DOLOMITE- light gray brown firm very fine sucrosic silty to very fine \narenaceous trace intercrystalline porosity faint dull yellow green fluorescence trace dark brown \nspotty hydrocarbon stain immediate pale yellow green milky cut, and above that was \nSILTACEOUS CALCAREOUS DOLOMITE- light gray brown firm very fine sucrosic silty to very \nfine arenaceous trace intercrystalline porosity faint dull yellow green fluorescence trace dark \nbrown spotty hydrocarbon stain immediate pale yellow green milky cut  The lithology and \ngamma signatures throughout the well were fairly consistent and often identified through the \nlateral.  Total Gas readings while drilling through the Target Zone ranged from 1200 to 2600 \nbackground units in the first half of the lateral and increasing to 2500 to 3500 background units \nin the second half.  A green frothy oil was observed in the possum belly and on the shakers \nthroughout the lateral while drilling.  The lateral was completed in two runs so the only trip gas \nwas 3531 units@ MD 14418\u2019.The Gas Buster was on the entire lateral and the flares were \nconsistently 3-8\u2019 and peaking as high as 20\u2019.   \nGEO STEERING \nThe Target Zone within the Middle Member of the Bakken Formation is 10 vertical feet thick \nand is directly beneath approximately 3-4 vertical feet of higher gamma slightly siltaceous \ncalcareous dolomite.  The top of the target exists 15\u2019 beneath the base of the Upper Bakken \nShale, the bottom of the target exists 25\u2019 beneath the base of the Upper Bakken Shale.  The \ninitial well plan was to land in the Target Zone approximately 15\u2019 below the top of the Upper \nBakken Shale and drill the lateral up dip at 90.09\u00ba.  The curve was landed approximately 8\u2019 \nbelow the base of the Upper Bakken Shale at MD 11371\u2019 TVD 10532\u2019 at a projected inclination \nof 90.57\u00ba. Upon landing the curve, steering inputs were implemented as required to maintain \nthe upward trajectory of the wellbore, verify formation dip, and maximize ROP and exposure to \nfavorable reservoir rock.  \nFORMATION TOPS AND CORRELATION\n\n9 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 1.

ROP\n\n13\n \n \nGEOLOGIST\u2019S CONCLUSIONS \n \nThe oil and gas shows observed while drilling the Columbus Federal 1-16H were consistently \ngood.  A maximum of 8% oil was present in the mud at the shaker during the lateral.  The gas \nshows did not increase until the last quarter of the hole\u2019s vertical section and were still \nunimpressive.  Possible fractured intervals were encountered while drilling the curve, however \nnot apparent in the lateral.  The Scallion Interval appeared to be fractured with over 2550 units \nof gas encountered before entering the Upper Bakken Shale.  If you consider that the Gas \nBuster was on for the entirety of the lateral, the gas shows were actually impressive averaging \n~1500 units to 2200 units for the majority of the lateral and over 3400 units near the end of the \nlateral.  Subsurface structural control utilizing cuttings evaluation and MWD gamma was \nsufficient to allow drilling the hole with low potential for stratigraphic positional \nmisinterpretation.  Unique sample and gamma signatures from the beds directly adjacent to \nthe Target Zone aided geological interpretation; however, it was not always consistent \nthroughout the lateral.

The approval is granted on \nthe condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than the 200' setback from the north & south \nboundaries and 1220' setback (per Commission policy) from the east & west boundaries within the 1280 acre spacing unit consisting of \nSections 4 & 9-T153N-R101W.  \n \nPERMIT STIPULATIONS: No Drilling Pit will be allowed.  The Rat and Mouse hole must be cemented.  In cases where a \nspacing unit is accessed from an off-site drill pad, an affidavit must be provided affirming that the surface owner of the multi-\nwell pad agrees to accept burial on their property of the cuttings generated from drilling the well(s) into an offsite \nspacing/drilling unit.  Due to surficial water adjacent to the well site, a dike is required surrounding the entire location.  \nCONTINENTAL RESOURCES, INC. must run open hole logs to include a porosity and resistivity log from KOP to the base \nof the surface casing.  Liner required under the location.  Spill contingency plan must be in place prior to spud.  \nCONTINENTAL RESOURCES must contact NDIC Field Inspector Richard Dunn at 701-770-3554 prior to location \nconstruction. \n \nDrilling pit \nNDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that \u201ca pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well drilling and completion \noperations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will prevent pollution of the land surface and \nfreshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits are prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized \nrepresentative of the director prior to lining and use.  Drill cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director \nprior to placement in a cuttings pit.\u201d \n \nForm 1 Changes & Hard Lines  \n  Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.  The proposed directional \nplan is at a legal location.  The minimum legal coordinates from the well head at casing point are: 2869\u2019 N & 902\u2019 W.   Also, based on the \nazimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum legal coordinate from the well head is: 12908\u2019 N and a minimum legal coordinate from the \nwell head of 902\u2019 W. \n \nLocation Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period) \n   Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the approved drilling permit \non the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report.   If circumstances require operations to commence before the 3rd business day following \npublication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may be waived by the Director.  Application for a waiver must be by sworn \naffidavit providing the information necessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and \nany other information that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the drilling permit, \nthe applicant should retain the permit. \n \nPermit Fee & Notification \n \nPayment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card.  It is requested that notification be given immediately upon the \nspudding of the well.  This information should be relayed to the Oil & Gas Division, Bismarck, via telephone.  The following information \nmust be included:  Well name, legal location, permit number, drilling contractor, company representative, date and time of spudding.  \nOffice hours are 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is (701) 328-8020, leave a \nmessage if after hours or on the weekend.\n\nTerry L. Olson \nMarch 11, 2013 \nPage 2 \n \n   Survey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells \n \nNDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey contractor shall file a certified \ncopy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion.  Surveys must be submitted as one electronic copy, or \nin a form approved by the director. However, the director may require the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the \nsurvey is needed to conduct the operation of the director's office in a timely manner.  Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one \nadobe document, with a certification cover page to certsurvey@nd.gov. \nSurvey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.  \nSpecifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve (or when sliding) and 90 \nfeet in the lateral. \n \nConfidential status \n \nYour request for confidential status of all information furnished to the Director, or his representatives, is hereby granted.  Such \ninformation, except production runs, shall remain confidential for six months commencing on the date the well is spud. \n \nConfidential status notwithstanding, the Director and his representatives shall have access to all well records wherever located. \nYour company personnel, or any person performing work for your company shall permit the Director and his representatives to come \nupon any lease, property, well, or drilling rig operated or controlled by them, complying with all safety rules, and to inspect the records and \noperation of such wells and to have access at all times to any and all records of wells. The Commission's field personnel periodically inspect \nproducing and drilling wells.  Any information regarding such wells shall be made available to them at any time upon request.  The \ninformation so obtained by the field personnel shall be maintained in strict confidence and shall be available only to the Commission and \nits staff. \n \nSurface casing cement \n \nTail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12 hours, and tail cement \nutilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi before drilling the plug or initiating tests.   \n \nLogs \n \nNDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of (1) a suite of open hole logs from which formation tops and porosity zones \ncan be determined, (2) a Gamma Ray Log run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore, and (3) a log from which the \npresence and quality of cement can be determined (Standard CBL or Ultrasonic cement evaluation log) in every well in which production \nor intermediate casing has been set, this log must be run prior to completing the well.  All logs run must be submitted free of charge, as \none digital TIFF (tagged image file format) copy and one digital LAS (log ASCII) formatted copy. Digital logs may be submitted on a \nstandard CD, DVD, or attached to an email sent to digitallogs@nd.gov   Thank you for your cooperation.  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nSincerely,  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nDavid Tabor  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nEngineering Technician IV\n\nFrom WH\nFrom WH\nSacks\n5(48,5('\u0003$77$&+0(176\u001d\u0003\u0003&HUWLILHG\u0003VXUYH\\RU\nV\u0003SODW\u000f\u0003KRUL]RQWDO\u0003VHFWLRQ\u0003SODW\u000f\u0003HVWLPDWHG\u0003JHRORJLFDO\u0003WRSV\u000f\u0003proposed mud/cementing plan,\n6XUYH\\V\u0003DUH\u0003UHTXLUHG\u0003DW\u0003OHDVW\u0003HYHU\\\u0003\u0016\u0013\u0003IHHW\u0003LQ\u0003WKH\u0003EXLOG\u0003VHFWLRQ\u0003DQG\u0003HYHU\\\u0003\u001c\u0013\u0003IHHW\u0003LQ\u0003WKH\u0003ODWHUDO\u0003VHFWLRQ\u0003RI\u0003D\u0003KRUL]RQWDO\u0003ZHOO\u0011\u0003\u00030HDVXUHPHQW\u0003\nLQDFFXUDFLHV\u0003DUH\u0003QRW\u0003FRQVLGHUHG\u0003ZKHQ\u0003GHWHUPLQLQJ\u0003FRPSOLDQFH\u0003ZLWK\u0003WKH\u0003VSDFLQJ\u0012GULOOLQJ\u0003XQLW\u0003ERXQGDU\\\u0003VHWEDFN\u0003UHTXLUHPHQW\u0003H[FHSW\u0003LQ\u0003WKH\u0003\nIROORZLQJ\u0003VFHQDULRV\u001d\u0003\u0003\u0014\f\u0003:KHQ\u0003WKH\u0003DQJOH\u0003EHWZHHQ\u0003WKH\u0003ZHOO\u0003ERUH\u0003DQG\u0003WKH\u0003UHVSHFWLYH\u0003ERXQGDU\\\u0003LV\u0003\u0014\u0013\u0003GHJUHHV\u0003RU\u0003OHVV\u001e\u0003RU\u0003\u0015\f\u0003,I\u0003,QGXVWU\\\u0003VWDQGDUG\nPHWKRGV\u0003DQG\u0003HTXLSPHQW\u0003DUH\u0003QRW\u0003XWLOL]HG\u0011\u0003\u0003&RQVXOW\u0003WKH\u0003DSSOLFDEOH\u0003ILHOG\u0003RUGHU\u0003IRU\u0003H[FHSWLRQV\u0011\n\u0003\n,I\u0003PHDVXUHPHQW\u0003LQDFFXUDFLHV\u0003DUH\u0003UHTXLUHG\u0003WR\u0003EH\u0003FRQVLGHUHG\u000f\u0003D\u0003\u0015\u0083\u00030:'\u0003PHDVXUHPHQW\u0003LQDFFXUDF\\\u0003ZLOO\u0003EH\u0003DSSOLHG\u0003WR\u0003WKH\u0003KRUL]RQWDO\u0003SRUWLRQ\u0003RI\u0003WKH\u0003ZHOO\u0003\nERUH\u0011\u0003\u00037KLV\u0003PHDVXUHPHQW\u0003LQDFFXUDF\\\u0003LV\u0003DSSOLHG\u0003WR\u0003WKH\u0003ZHOO\u0003ERUH\u0003IURP\u0003.23\u0003WR\u00037'\u0011\nDrilling Mud Type (Lateral)\nDrilling Mud Type (Vertical Hole -

(CRD) respectfully submits the following information concerning the\nprevention of a wellbore collision while drilling the Columbus Federal 3-161, SENE of Sec. 16, T153N,\nR101W, Dunn County, North Dakota.\nThe Mildred 1, NDIC File No, 12306, is a plugged aud abandoned, Red River formation, directional\nwell with a SHL of 1325\u201d FSL, 660\u00b0 FEL of Sec. 4, T1S3N, RIOQLW. The directional wellbore lies\napproximately 660\u00b0 FEL of See. 4, T153N, R1IO1W, terminating at a BHL 769\u00b0 N. of SHL, 2094\u2019 FSL\nof Sec. 4, T1S3N, RIOIW. Botlom hole TVD of the existing directional well is 13451\u2019, The deepest\ncasing string is 8-5/8\u201d set at a depth of 3035\u201d TVD.\nThe proposed Columbus Federal 3-16H1 is a horizontal well targeting the Middle Bukken formation.\nSurface hole location for the Columbus Federal 3-16H is 2469 FSL and 199\u00b0 FEL of Sec, 16, TI53N,\nRIOLW. The majority of the Columbus Federal 3-16H lateral will lie 760\u00b0 FEL in order to avoid the\nexisting Mildred 1 wellbore by approximately 100\u00b0. The lateral will taper back to 660\u00b0 FEL, at 10155\u00b0\nN. of SHL, after adequately clearing the sogment of the Mildred 1 wellbore within this Baker-Dakken\npool.\n\u2018The Baker-Bakken pool, as defined by NDIC Order No. 21551, is the interval from 50 feet above the top\nof the Bakken Fotmation (o above the top of the Birdbear Formation. CRI has assessed the geology of\nthe area and has determined this Bakken interval to be approximately 10461\u2019 TVD to 10,771\" TVD. On\nthe surface planar, the Mildred 1 wellbore exist in this interval for approximalely 38\u00b0, from 1874\u00b0 FST\nto 1912' FSL of Sec. 4, TIS3N, RW.\n\u2018The completion of the Columbus Federal 3-L6H will protect the integrity of the Mildred 1 wellbore.\nStimulation plans will be made to include a buffer zone with swell packers of a minimum 300\u00b0 from\neither side of the Mildred 1 wellbore existing within the Baker-Baicken pool, This zone will not be\nperforated or completed.\nCRI believes adequate precautions have been taken to prevent the possibility of a wellbore collision and\naccepts all respousibility should such a collision ovcur.\nSarah Madden, PD Enginoer\nContinental Resources.

The storage tanks on site store petroleum based drilling mud,\ndiesel fuel, the invert tanks being the base for the drilling mud, salt water tanks,\nfresh water tanks, crude oil storage tanks and empty tanks for emergency\nstorage. in addition to the storage tanks, other operations that can produce\ncontaminants are the drilling operation itself and the cuttings drying operation. It\nis the purpose of this plan to define the prevention containment and\ncountermeasure plan for discharges from any of these sources on the site. All\nthe actions taken in this regard are per approved policies of this part of 40 CFR\n112. Universally and in setting up the drilling operation on the site prevention\nmeasures are taken by grading the site to contain discharges, building in\neffective valves and other related operational and control mechanisms to prevent\ndischarges. This equipment is installed and tested prior to beginning drilling\noperations. The tanks and equipment are installed within secondary containment\nberms and containment trenches and sumps are installed around the facilities\nprior to beginning drilling operations with capacity to contain with freeboard a\nrupture of the largest vessel associated with the containment. In the event of a\ndischarge the sites are equipped with vacuums that are capable of picking up the\nspilled material and loading it into containers where it can be transferred to an\napproved disposal location. In the event of a discharge larger than can be\nhandled by Cyclone and other manpower on location or that leaks offsite and\npotentially into navigable waters of the US, the operator, under his directions will\narrange for trained contract personnel to immediately contain and clean-up the\ndischarge.\n112.7(a)(2} This plan will comply with all applicable items of this part. With\nno deviations anticipated.\n412.7(a)(3} The attached sketch shows a typical layout of the drill rig sites\ndepicting the location, size and contents of the tanks. There are no\nunderground tanks nor are there any mobile or portable containers\nassociated with these drilling locations. The site is prepared in advance of\nthe drill rig coming onto the site. The sites are designed and constructed to\ncontain spills and tank ruptures on the site. The drill rig and associated tanks\nand equipment are laid out in an efficient and effective manner to streamline the\ndrilling operation. Frack tanks are located in such a manner that they have easy\naccess to the mud tanks with valves located on both ends of transfer lines. The\ndrilling mud tanks are plumbed to the drill rig with valves appropriately located to\nPage 1 of 6\n\nstop flow from the tanks to the rig or from the rig to the tanks. The cuttings from\nthe drilling operation are screened from the recycled drilling mud and directed to\na container were they are dried using fly ash or some other equally effective\nabsorbent material and are then transferred to the lined cuttings disposal pit\nonsite. The fuel tank is tied into the fuel lines providing fuel flow to the\ngenerators. Blowout preventers are placed over the drill hole casing and tested\nprior to beginning the drilling.\n112.7(aX3i) The type of oil in each fixed container and its storage\ncapacity.

When the rig is moved ont the site and set up additional discharge\nprevention and containment measures are taken. Equipment inspection records\n\nPage 2 of 6\n\nare reviewed and the equipment is inspected following written procedures, the\nwritten procedures are attached in the appendix of the plan. A dated record of the\ninspection, signed by the appropriate supervisor or inspector is recorded and\nfiled with time sheets or safety meeting minutes, when the drill tig changes\nlocations and notes of deficiencies or acceptance are included. Operation and\nmaintenance of equipment is designed to prevent discharges. Personnel are\ntrained and made aware of the discharge prevention procedures and applicable\npollution control laws, rules and regulations. The tool pusher in charge of the drill\nsig will have in his possession a copy of the Cyclone Drilling SPCC Plan and it is\nhis responsibility to instruct the employees and make them aware of the\ndischarge prevention measures contained in the plan. Scheduled briefings and\ntefreshers are to be conducted with all the employees prior to and during rig up\noperations, such briefings are to be held during regularly scheduled safety\nmeetings.\n\nEmployees are assigned to make routine inspections of valves, hose connections\nand other fluid connections for leaks. These inspections are made and\ndocumented on a monthly basis at a minimum. These leaks are provided drip\npans and reported to the appropriate personnel for repair. If repairs cannot be\nreadily made then regular emptying of the drip pans is required until the repairs\ncan be made. Inspections of trenches and sumps are made on a regular basis to\ninsure that they are free flowing and functional. The containment berms are also\ninspected periodically to insure their stability and function.\n\n112.7(a)(3)(iii) Discharge or drainage controls such as secondary\ncontainment around containers and other structures, equipment, and\nprocedures for the control of the discharge; Containment berms are placed\naround the tanks containing crude oil, the invert dritling fluid, salt water tanks and\nthe empty tanks to be used for emergency storage, as secondary containment.\nThe containment berms are of adequate height to contain a rupture and total\nfailure of the largest tank contained within it amounting to 400 BBLS requiring a\ncontainment capacity of 3,000 cu. ft. Similarly, berms are built around the crude\noil storage tanks on the site and requiring the same containment volume. Berms\nor trenches and sumps are constructed around the drill rig itself, the drilling mud\ntanks and diesel fuel tank, the sumps and trenches are sized to contain the\nvolume of the largest tank in the case of a rupture and complete failure.\nAdditionally, drip pans are placed under leaking valves, hose joints and other\nsources of smail leaks until the item can be replaced or repaired to not leak.\nRegular inspections of these facilities are made to insure that they will function\nper plan.\n\n112.7(a)(3)(iv) Countermeasures for discharge discovery, response, and\ncleanup (both the facility's capability and those that might be required of a\ncontractor); Regular inspections may reveal a discharge such as a leaking\nvalve or hose joint. These instances can readily be cleaned up by employees of\nCyclone Orilling using on site vacuums and containers. Larger spills up to and\n\nPage 3 of 6\n\nbeyond the reporting limits can also be handled by Cyclone Drilling employees.\nSpills that exceed the limitations of the onsite cleanup equipment or in the event\nof a spill migrating offsite, will require the tool pushers\u2019 notification of the\noperator/owner of the site and they will contact the clean-up contractor thay have\ncontracted with to contain and clean-up such events.\n412.7(a\\(3)(v) Methods of disposal of recovered materials in accordance\nwith applicable legal requirements: When spills occur the fluids will be either\nsoaked up with absorptive material and placed in a container for transporting to\nan approved disposal site or vacuumed up and placed in a storage container for\ntransportation to an approved disposal site. It is understood by ail Cyclone\nDrilling employees that there is not an approved disposal site on or around the\ndrilling rig to dispose of these recovered materials or fluids, other than drying\ndrilling cuttings and disposing of them in the cuttings pit.\n112.7(a)(3)(vi) Contact list and phone numbers for the facility response\ncoordinator, National Response Center, cleanup contractors with whom\noperator has an agreement for response, and all appropriate Federal, State,\nand local agencies who must be contacted in the event of a discharge as\ndescribed in \u00a7 112.1(b). Facility Response Coordinator for Cyclone Drilling\nHSE Dept. (Ph. 307-682-4161) is responsible for contacting the operators\nenvironmental group so they can contact the appropriate Federal, State and\nLocal personnel in the event of a discharge as described in \u00a7 112.1(b).\n112.7(a)(4) Information and procedures to enable a person reporting a\ndischarge as described in \u00a7 112.1(b) to relate information on the exact\naddress or location and phone number of the facility; the date and time of\nthe discharge, the type of material discharged; estimates of the total\nquantity discharged; estimates of the quantity discharged as described in\n\u00a7 112.1(b); the source of the discharge: a description of all affected media;\nthe cause of the discharge; any damages or injuries caused by the\ndischarge; actions being used to stop, remove, and mitigate the effects of\nthe discharge; whether an evacuation may be needed; and, the names of\nindividuals and/or organizations who have also been contacted. In the\nevent of a discharge as described in \u00a7112.1(b) it is the responsibility of the tool\npusher to relate the above information to the operators environmental group so\nthey can contact, any emergency organizations and provide the reporting\nnecessary to the Federal, State and Local agencies that require reporting of such\na discharge. The tool pusher on the rig is the person in charge and either he or\nthe drilling superintendent have the responsibility of reporting the answers to the\nabove questions. These questions are spelled out on a \u201cDischarge Reporting\nForm\u201d that each has at his disposal in the appendix of \u201cCyclone Drilling Oil Spill\nContingency Plan\u201d In reporting a discharge a list of all individuals and or\norganizations that received the report will be listed.\n\nPage 4 of 6\n\n112.7(a)(5) Plan procedures to be used when a discharge occurs:\n\n1) Immediately extinguish any heater or fire that may ignite the spill.\n\n2) No smoking during spill control operations.\n\n3) Close all associated valves.\n\n4) Direct discharge to ditches or drains that will carry the discharge to a safe\nholding sump or reserve pit.\n\n5) Distribute hill, fibertex, gel, barite, or any other absorptive material available\nas required to contain the discharge not entering the ditch, sump or reserve\npit.\n\n6) Inspect area to ensure that all of the discharge is contained in ditches, sumps\nor reserve pits. Add ditches or diversion structures as required to contain the\ndischarge onsite.\n\n7) Start jet or sump pumps and transfer discharged material from sumps to\nreserve pit or holding tanks.\n\n8) After discharge is stopped, collect all used hulls, fibertex and similar\nabsorptive material for disposal per instruction from the drilling superintendent\nor the tool pusher. No oil is to remain in the ditches or sumps that may create\na fire hazard.\n\n9) Hold collected discharged material for hauling and disposal in an approved\nlocation.\n\n10) If discharge migrates from the drill rig location Cyclone Drilling personne! will\nuse these same procedures stop and recover the discharge. Additionally the\ntool pusher will notify the owners representative to notify the contract clean-\nup company for clean-up and mitigation of the offsite discharge migration.\n\n11) Fill out Site Discharge Reporting Form and distribute to appropriate agencies\nand personnel. (Form included in Appendix of Plan)\n\n112.7(a)(5)(b) Flow diagram of potential discharges from significant\n\nsources as a result of facilities failure: Flow diagrams and quantities\n\nincluded in appendix of the plan.\n\n112.7(a)(5\\(c) Site discharge containment system: The site discharge\n\ncontainment system for the Cyclone Drilling Rigs is a combination of containment\n\nberms, confinement trenches, sumps and reserve pits. Drip pans will be used for\nsmall discharges until repairs are make or equipment replaced. (See typical site\nplan included in appendix.)\n\n112.7(a)(5)(d) Not applicable as all measures spelled out in this part are\n\npractical as describe in each section.\n\n112.7(a)(5)(e) Inspections, tests and records: Written procedures are\n\nprovided on the \u201cDischarge Source Inspection Record\", these inspections are\n\nrecorded at least on a monthly basis or whenever a leak or discharge is detected\nand reported, using the \u201cDischarge Source Inspection Record\u201d in the appendix.\n\nThese records are signed by the tool pusher onsite and maintained by Cyclone\n\nDrilling for a period of 3 years.\n\nPage 5 of 6\n\n112.7(a)(5}(f} Personnel Training and Discharge Prevention Procedures:\nThe personnel working on the drilling crews are trained in the maintenance and\noperation of all the equipment to prevent discharges, the discharge procedures\nand generai facility operations. They are also made aware of the contents of the\nSPCC Plan. The tool pusher on each crew is the person on the locatian who is\naccountable for discharge prevention and who reports to the Cyclone Drilling\nManagement. The tool pusher is responsible for conducting discharge\nprevention briefings and assuring an adequate understanding of the Cyclone\nDrilling SPCC Plan for the facility and any recent developments of new\nprecautionary measures due to fallures or malfunctions are implemented.\n112.7(a)(5)(g) Site Security: All persons entering the site are required to check\nin with the tool pusher of the on duty crew. Unauthorized persons are not\nallowed on the site. Unauthorized visitors are easily detected, questioned\nregarding there presents and appropriately escorted to take care of their\nbusiness.\n112.7(a)(5)(h) Facility Tank Truck Leading/Unloading: The tank truck\nloading and unloading areas on the Cyclone Drilling Sites are located adjacent to\nthe frack tank or crude oil tank batteries the area adjacent to the tank battery,\nwhere tank trucks are loaded and unloaded will be graded to drain info the\ncontainment trenches and associated sump, surrounding the drill rig, mud tanks,\nfuel tank, ete. Wheel chocks are used to prevent the truck from moving while\nconnected to the tanks during loading/unloading operations. Before departure\nthe vehicle is inspected for leaks in the lowermost drains and outlets and if they\nare any detected the associated valves are tightened or adjusted to prevent\ndischarge while in transit. All above ground containers are checked and\nevaluated for risk of discharge or failure and as necessary appropriate action\nshall be taken.\n\nPage 6 of 6\n\nRES OuR CES\nNovember 20, 2012\nIndustrial Commission of North Dakota\nOil & Gas Division\n600 East Boulevard, Dept 405\nBismarck, North Dakota 58505\nRe: Columbus Federal 1-16H\nContinental Resources, Inc., would like to request all filings and information regarding the above\ncaptioned well be considered \u201cTight Hole\u201d.\nPlease charge the Continental Resources, Inc., credit card that is on file with your agency for the\napplication fec of this well.\nThank you for your prompt attention to this matter.
