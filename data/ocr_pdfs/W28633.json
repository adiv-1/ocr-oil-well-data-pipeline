Nabors B22 drilling the Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC - Chalmers 5300 21-19 5T \nduring September-November, 2014 in the Camp Field, McKenzie County, North Dakota. \n(G. Wayne Peterson, Sunburst Consulting) \n \nINTRODUCTION  \n \nThe Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC Chalmers 5300 21-19 5T [Lot 2 Section 19, \nT153N, R100W] is located approximately 7 miles south of the town of Williston in McKenzie \nCounty, North Dakota. The Chalmers 5300 21-19 5T is a horizontal Three Forks well within the \nWilliston Basin consisting of one 9,730' lateral drilled toward the east. The vertical hole was \nplanned to be drilled to approximately 10,341\u2019. The curve would be built at 12 degrees per 100\u2019 \nto land within the Three Forks. This well is a two section lateral which originates in the \nnorthwest quarter of section 19, then drilled east to the northeast quarter of section 20. \nDirectional drilling technologies and geo-steering techniques were used to land in the Three \nForks reservoir and maintain exposure to the ideal target rock."

Offset well control was essential in curve operations, to \nsuccessfully land within the Three Forks. Formation thicknesses expressed by gamma ray \nsignatures in these wells were compared to gamma data collected during drilling operations in \norder to successfully land the curve. The target landing true vertical depth (TVD) was \nperiodically updated during drilling to ensure accurate landing of the curve.  \n \nGEOLOGY \n \nThe Charles Formation [Mississippian Madison Group] was logged 8,535' MD 8,534' TVD        \n(-6,458' SS). Samples in the lower portion of the Charles Formation consisted of a limestone \nmudstone, which was light brown, light gray brown, off white in color. It was microcrystalline, \nfriable, laminated, with an earthy texture. A trace of intercrystalline porosity, as was rare spotty \nlight brown oil stain Occasionally noted was a  dolomite mudstone, which was light brown, light \ngray brown in color. It was microcrystalline, friable-firm, laminated, with an earthy texture. Also \nnoted was a trace of intercrystalline porosity, and occasional spotty light brown oil stain. Rarely \nnoted was anhydrite, which was off white, cream in color. It was soft, microcrystalline, and \nmassive with an earthy to amorphous texture. Following connections or periods of non-\ncirculation, gas peaks of 12 to 33 units were noted, as were drilling gas shows of 15 to 36 units.   \n \nThe Mission Canyon Formation [Mississippian Madison Group] was logged 9,432' MD 9,431' \nTVD (-7,355' SS). The Mission Canyon Formation consisted of a lime mudstone that was \ndescribed as light gray, light brown, gray brown, trace dark gray in color. The lime mudstone \nwas predominately friable to firm, with an earthy to rarely crystalline in texture. Some intervals \ncontained a trace of black-brown algal material, a trace of fossil fragments, and traces of \ndisseminated pyrite. Also present was an argillaceous lime mudstone that was described as light \ngray, occasional medium gray, rare gray tan, rare off white, trace dark gray in color. The \nargillaceous \nlime \nmudstone \nwas \npredominately firm to friable, crystalline \nto \nchalky \ntexture. \nSome \nintervals \ncontained a trace of disseminated pyrite.  \nFollowing connections or periods of non-\ncirculation, gas peaks of 28 to 45 units \nwere noted, as were drilling gas shows of \n35 to 83 units.  Rare intercrystalline \nporosity was noted as well as traces to \noccasional spotty light brown oil stain was \noccasionally observed while logging the \nMission Canyon Formation. \n \n \n                                  \nFigure 2.

The black to black gray carbonaceous and \npetroliferous shale was hard with a splintery to smooth texture. Fracture porosity was noted, and \ntrace minerals were observed to include disseminated pyrite and calcite fracture fill. \nHydrocarbons evaluated in this interval reached a maximum of 546 units drilling gas, with a \nconnection gas of 552 units.  \n \nThe Middle Member [Mississippian-Devonian Bakken Formation] was drilled at 10,820' MD \n10,742' TVD (-8,666' SS). Samples in the Middle Bakken Member were predominantly silty \nsandstone which was described as light gray brown, light brown, trace light gray in color. It was \nvery fine grained, friable, subround, smooth, moderately sorted, with calcite cement, moderately \ncemented. A trace of disseminated and nodular pyrite was noted as was fair intergranular \nporosity. Also noted was common light to medium brown spotty to even oil stain. Hydrocarbons \nevaluated in this interval reached a maximum of 118 units drilling gas, with a survey gas of 80 \nunits. \n \nThe Lower Shale Member [Mississippian-Bakken Formation] was drilled at 10,898' MD 10,783' \nTVD (-8,707' SS). Entry into this interval was characterized by high gamma, elevated \nbackground gas and increased rates of penetration. The carbonaceous black, black gray shale is \npetroliferous, hard, splintery, smooth and exhibits possible fracture porosity. Trace minerals \nincluded disseminated pyrite. Drilling gas in this interval reached a maximum of 132 units. \n \nThe \nPronghorn \nMember \n[Devonian-\nBakken Formation] was reached at 10,930' \nMD 10,795' TVD (-8,719' SS). Entry into \nthis interval was characterized by lower \ngamma, and slightly slower penetration \nrates. Samples from the Pronghorn were \ndescribed as siltstone which was dark gray \ntrace gray black, friable to firm, subblocky \nto subsplit. This siltstone was moderately \ndolomite \ncemented \nand \nincluded \ndisseminated and nodular pyrite. Also \nnoted was a trace of spotty light brown oil \nstain.

Oil and gas shows at the shakers and in samples \nwere continuously monitored. In the closed mud system, hydrostatic conditions were maintained \nnear balance, this allowed for gas and fluid gains from the well to be evaluated. Gas on the \nChalmers 5300 21-19 5T varied according to stratigraphic position and penetration rates which \nmay have reflected increased porosity. During the vertical, connection gas peaks of 12 to 45 \nunits were noted, as were drilling gas shows of 12 to 83 units, against a 10.34-11.4 lb/gal diesel-\ninvert mud weight. Background concentrations in the lateral ranged from 100 to 1,800 units, \nagainst a 9.65-9.75 lb/gal saltwater gel drilling fluid. Connection peaks of 400 to 800 units were \nobserved, coinciding with the best shows. Drilling out of casing at 11,198 MD\u2019 yielded a trip gas \nof 2,259 units, and trips at 17,104\u2019 MD, and 17,182\u2019 MD and 19,990\u2019 MD yielded trip gas of \n4,819 units, and 1,618 units, respectively. After a trip at 19,990\u2019 MD, due to problems associated \nwith the extreme cold weather the flow was diverted from the shakers and no trip gasses were \nnoted. Chromatography of gas revealed typical concentrations of methane, characteristic of \nThree Forks gas."

The RP directional drillers and MWD, and Sunburst Consulting personnel \nworked closely together throughout the project to evaluate data and make steering decisions to \nmaximize the amount of borehole in the targeted zones and increase rate of penetration (ROP) of \nthe formation.  \n \nThe 913\u2019 curve was drilled in 23 hours with a bottom hole assembly (BHA) consisting of bit #4, \na Security MMD55M PDC bit, attached to a 2.38 degree fixed NOV 7/8 5.0 motor and MWD \ntools. The curve was successfully landed at 11,198\u2019 MD and 10,834\u2019 TVD, approximately 21\u2019 \ninto the Three Forks Formation. Seven inch diameter 32# HCP-110 casing was set to 11,150\u2019 \nMD.  \n \nGeologic structure maps of the Chalmers 5300 21-19 5T and surrounding control wells had \nestimated formation dip to be a down dip at approximately -0.5\u00ba down to the TD of the lateral. \nThe preferred drilling interval of the Chalmers 5300 21-19 5T consisted of a ten foot zone \nlocated approximately sixteen feet into the Three Forks Formation. Penetration rates, gas shows, \ngamma ray data, and sample observations were utilized to keep the wellbore in the preferred \nstratigraphic position in the target zone. Using offset well data provided by Oasis representatives, \nprojected porosity zones were identified in the preferred drilling areas.  \n \n \n \nFigure 9.  Offset Well Target Definition, Indian Hills Prospect (Oasis).   \n \nSteering decisions were made by using the low gamma in the lower portion of the target zone to \nestablish the well-bore\u2019s position in the target zone. If the well-bore moved lower, the higher \ngamma of the underlying claystone (G) was observed, as was the presence of claystone in \ncollected samples. Slides were then utilized to move the well-bore back up into the target zone. \nAs the well-bore moved higher, approaching the top of the target zone the high to medium \nfluctuating gamma (D) was noted. Samples in the lower gamma portion of the target zone \ncontained noticeably greater concentrations of the light brown-light brown gray, tan-cream, trace \npink dolomite; as the well-bore moved higher in zone the samples tended to have more of the \nlight gray, off white, gray brown dolomite.

The \napproval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than \nthe 500' setback from the north & south boundaries and 200' setback from the east & west boundaries within the \n1280 acre spacing unit consisting of Sections 19 & 20 T153N R100W.  \n \nPERMIT STIPULATIONS: Due to the proximity of Lake Sakakawea to the well site, a dike is required \nsurrounding the entire location.  Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for \nfilter sock disposal must be maintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, and must \nremain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations are \nconducted.  OASIS PETRO NO AMER must contact NDIC Field Inspector Richard Dunn at 701-770-\n3554 prior to location construction. \n \nDrilling pit \nNDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that \u201ca pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well \ndrilling and completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will \nprevent pollution of the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits \nare prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized representative of the director prior to lining and use.  \nDrill cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings \npit.\u201d \n \nForm 1 Changes & Hard Lines  \n  Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.  \nThe proposed directional plan is at a legal location.  Based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum \nlegal coordinate from the well head is: 9971\u2019 east. \n \nLocation Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period) \n   Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the \napproved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report.   If circumstances require operations to \ncommence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may \nbe waived by the Director.  Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information \nnecessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other \ninformation that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the \ndrilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit."

It is requested \nthat notification be given immediately upon the spudding of the well.  This information should be relayed to the \nOil & Gas Division, Bismarck, via telephone.  The following information must be included:  Well name, legal \nlocation, permit number, drilling contractor, company representative, date and time of spudding.  Office hours are \n8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is (701) 328-8020, leave a \nmessage if after hours or on the weekend.  \n \nSurvey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells \n   NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey contractor \nshall file a certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion.  Surveys \nmust be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director may \nrequire the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the \noperation of the director's office in a timely manner.  Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe \ndocument, with a certification cover page to certsurvey@nd.gov.    \nSurvey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.  \nSpecifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve \n(or when sliding) and 90 feet in the lateral. \n \nSurface casing cement \n \nTail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12 \nhours, and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi \nbefore drilling the plug or initiating tests.   \n \nLogs \n \nNDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of (1) a suite of open hole logs from which formation tops and \nporosity zones can be determined, (2) a Gamma Ray Log run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore, and \n(3) a log from which the presence and quality of cement can be determined (Standard CBL or Ultrasonic cement evaluation \nlog) in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set, this log must be run prior to completing the well.  \nAll logs run must be submitted free of charge, as one digital TIFF (tagged image file format) copy and one digital LAS (log \nASCII) formatted copy. Digital logs may be submitted on a standard CD, DVD, or attached to an email sent to \ndigitallogs@nd.gov \n   \nThank you for your cooperation.  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nSincerely,  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nNathaniel Erbele  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nPetroleum Resource Specialist"

    "text": "April 9, 2014 \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRE:  Filter Socks and Other Filter Media \n \n \n \n \nLeakproof Container Required \n \n \n \n \nOil and Gas Wells \n \nDear Operator, \n \nNorth Dakota Administrative Code Section 43-02-03-19.2 states in part that all waste material associated with \nexploration or production of oil and  gas must be properly disposed of in an authorized facility in accord with all \napplicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations. \n \nFiltration systems are commonly used during oil and gas operations in North Dakota.  The Commission is very \nconcerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry. \n \nEffective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the \nwell is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations \nare conducted.  The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an \nauthorized facility.  Such containers must be: \n\uf0b7 \nleakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container \n\uf0b7 \ncovered to prevent precipitation from entering the container \n\uf0b7 \nplacard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container \n \nIf the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but \nonly upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request. \n \nAs previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01 \nstates in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production \nwastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste \nManagement.  Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the \nsolid waste program.  Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud, \ninvert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.  \n \nThank you for your cooperation.  \n \n \n \nSincerely, \n \n \n \nBruce E. Hicks \n \n \nAssistant Director"
