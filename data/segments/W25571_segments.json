Nabors B22 drilling the Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC - Colville 5301 44-12T \nduring July and August, 2013 in the Baker Field, McKenzie County, North Dakota. \n(G. Wayne Peterson, Sunburst Consulting) \n \nINTRODUCTION  \n \nOasis Petroleum North America, LLC. Colville 5301 44-12T [SE SE Sec. 12-T153N-R101W] is \nlocated approximately 3 miles south of Williston in McKenzie County, North Dakota. The \nColville 5301 44-12T is a horizontal Three Forks development well in part of Oasis Petroleum\u2019s \nCamp prospect within the Williston Basin. The vertical hole was planned to be drilled to \napproximately 10,333\u2019. The curve would be built at 12 degrees per 100\u2019 to land within the Three \nForks. This well is a two section lateral which originates in the southeast quarter of section 12, \nthen drilled south across section 13, to the southeast quarter of section 24 (Figure 2). Directional \ndrilling technologies and geo-steering techniques were used to land in the upper Three Forks \nreservoir and maintain exposure to the ideal target rock. \n \nOFFSET WELLS  \n \nThe primary offset wells used for depth correlation during curve operations were the Gulf Oil \nExploration and Production, Lindvig 1-11-3C; and the Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC \nAsh Federal 5300 11-18T. The Gulf Oil Exploration and Production, Lindvig 1-11-3C [SE SE \nSec. 11, T153N, R101W] is located approximately \u00bd of a mile west of the Colville 5301 44-12T. \nThis well was completed in March of 1982 reached a total depth of 13,800\u2019 true vertical depth \n(TVD). The Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC Ash Federal 5300 11-18T [Lot 1 Section 18,\n\nT153N, R100W] is located approximately east north east of the Colville 5301 44-12T. This well \nwas drilled to the Three Forks landing of 10,794\u2019 MD in August and September of 2012. The \nformation thicknesses expressed by gamma signatures in these wells, and the Oasis Petroleum \nNorth America, LLC Larry 5301 44-12B [SE NE Section 12, T153N, R101W] were used to \nassist in landing the curve. This was accomplished by comparing gamma signatures from the \noffset wells to gamma data collected during drilling operations. The casing target landing was \nperiodically updated to ensure accurate landing of the curve. Data used in this evaluation are \nincluded as an appendix to this report.  \n \n \n \nFigure 2.  Structure map of the Three Forks Top (subsea) with annotated offset wells (Oasis Petroleum). \n \nGEOLOGY  \n \nLithology \n \nThe Ratcliffe interval [Charles Formation] was drilled at 9,228' MD 9,227' TVD (-7,142') SS. \nThe top of this interval was observed as faster penetration rates were encountered, as the well \nbore transitioned from anhydrite to limestone. This limestone was tan to gray tan, light brown \ngray, occasional light brown, rare off white lime mudstone. This facies was microcrystalline, \nfirm, with an earthy to crystalline texture, as well as contained traces of disseminated pyrite. \nAlso noted in certain areas was a trace light brown oil stain; possible earthy to intercrystalline \nporosity may have been present \n \nThe Mission Canyon Formation [Mississippian Madison Group] was logged at 9,420' MD 9,419' \nTVD (-7,334') SS. The Mission Canyon Formation consisted of lime mudstone that was \ndescribed as light brown, light gray brown to brown, occasional cream, rare light gray, trace off \nwhite to white in color.  The Mission Canyon was predominately friable to firm, dense with an \nearthy to crystalline texture. Some intervals were trace siliceous with traces of disseminated\n\npyrite. Fossil fragments, along with black, dark brown algal laminations and a trace of stylolites \nwere visible in some samples throughout the Mission Canyon Formation. Following connections \nor periods of non-circulation, gas shows of 39 to 46 units were noted and a trace to rare spotty \nlight to medium brown spotty oil stain was occasionally observed while logging the Mission \nCanyon Formation. \n \n \n \nFigure 3. Limestone with spotty light to medium brown staining from the Mission Canyon Formation. \n \nThe Upper Bakken Shale Member [Mississippian-Bakken Formation] was drilled at 10,762' MD \n10,699' TVD (-8,614') SS. Entry into this member was characterized by high gamma, elevated \nbackground gas and increased rates of penetration. The black carbonaceous and petroliferous \nshale was sub blocky and firm with an earthy texture.  Trace minerals were observed to include \ndisseminated pyrite and calcite fracture fill. Hydrocarbons evaluated in this interval reached a \nmaximum of 305 units. \n \nThe Bakken Middle Member [Mississippian-Devonian] was reached at 10,792' MD 10,715' TVD \n(-8,630') SS. This formation was predominantly siltstone and silty sandstone noted by the \ndecreasing penetration rates, gamma API counts, and recorded gas levels, relative to the \noverlying source rock. The siltstone was light gray, sub-platy to sub-blocky, with an earthy \ntexture. It was moderately calcite cemented, with traces of disseminated pyrite. Also present was \nsilty sandstone which was light gray, light gray tan, rare buff, firm, very fine grained, well \nsorted, friable, sub-angular to sub-round, and contained possible intergranular porosity. It was \nmoderately calcite cemented. Trace minerals included disseminated and nodular pyrite. Drilling \ngas in this interval reached a maximum of 145 units, with a connection gas of 256 units. Also \nobserved was spotty light brown spotty oil stain.\n\nFigure 4. Sample from the Lower Bakken Shale Member \n \nThe Lower Bakken Shale Member [Devonian] was reached at 10,878' MD 10,758' TVD (-8,673') \nSS. This was 19\u2019 low to the Lindvig 1-11-3C. Entry into this interval was characterized by high \ngamma, elevated background gas and increased rates of penetration. The carbonaceous black, \nblack gray shale is petroliferous, with a blocky texture and exhibits possible fracture porosity. \nTrace minerals included disseminated pyrite. Drilling gas in this interval reached a maximum of \n312 units with a connection gas of 311 units. \n \nThe Pronghorn Member [Devonian-Bakken Formation] was reached at 10,906' MD 10,769' TVD \n(-8,684') SS. Entry into this interval was characterized by lower gamma, and slightly slower \npenetration rates. Samples from the Pronghorn were described as siltstone which was medium to \ndark gray, gray brown, friable, sub-platy to sub-blocky, with an earthy texture. This siltstone was \nmoderately dolomite cemented and included disseminated and nodular pyrite. Drilling gas in this \ninterval reached a maximum of 196 units with a connection gas of 278 units. \n \nThe Three Forks Formation [Devonian] was reached at 10,949' MD 10,783 TVD (-8,698') SS. \nThe target zone of the Three Forks was to be drilled in a predominatly dolomite eight foot zone \nbeginning 16 feet into the Three Forks Formation.  \n \n  \n \n \nFigure 5 & 6.  Sample of the predominately dolomitic facies in the preferred drilling zone of the Three Forks \nformation on left; sample from a brief contact with underlying claystone on the right.\n\nSamples in the Three Forks were commonly dolomite which is tan, cream, occasional light \nbrown, rare light gray tan, trace light gray. Additionally this facies was friable and dense with an \nearthy texture. It also contained a trace of disseminated and nodular pyrite. Possible \nintercrystalline porosity was observed, as was a rare to a trace of light brown spotty oil stain. \nPresent in varying amounts was light gray to off white, rare light green shale which was friable \nto firm, sub-blocky with an earthy texture. Trace of nodular and disseminated pyrite was noted in  \nthe shale which contained no visible porosity. \n \nGas Show  \n \nGas monitoring and fluid gains provided evidence of a hydrocarbon saturated reservoir during \nthe drilling of the Yukon 5301 41-12T. Oil and gas shows at the shakers and in samples were \ncontinuously monitored. In the closed mud system, hydrostatic conditions were maintained near \nbalance, this allowed for gas and fluid gains from the well to be evaluated. Gas on the Colville \n5301 44-12T varied according to stratigraphic position and penetration rates which may have \nreflected increased porosity. Background concentrations ranged from 300 to 600 units, and \nconnection peaks of 1,000 to 1,200 units were observed in the middle of the target zone. A trip at \n19,527\u2019 MD, yielded a trip gas of 1,545 units. Chromatography of gas revealed typical \nconcentrations of methane, ethane, propane and butane characteristic of Bakken and Three Forks \ngas (Figure 7).   \n \n \n \nFigure 7.

Profile displaying total gas, gamma ray and rate of penetration.  \n \nGeo-steering \n \nRyan Energy Technologies provided personnel and equipment for measurement-while-drilling \n(MWD) services. The RPM directional drillers MWD and Sunburst Consulting personnel \nworked closely together throughout the project to evaluate data and make steering decisions to \nmaximize the amount of borehole in the targeted zones and increase rate of penetration (ROP) of \nthe formation.  \n \nThe 873\u2019 curve was drilled in 24 hours with bit #2 a Security FXD55D, attached to a 2.38 degree \nfixed NOV 7/8 5 stage mud motor and MWD tools. The curve was successfully landed at \n11,173\u2019 MD, approximately 25\u2019 into the Three Forks Formation. Seven inch diameter 32# HCP-\n110 casing was set to 11,144\u2019 MD.  \n \nGeologic structure maps of the Colville 5301 44-12T and surrounding control wells, estimated \nformational dip to move down at approximately -0.3\u00ba initially, then reverse due to a plunging \nsyncline at about 2,500\u2019, reversing to an estimated 0.5\u00ba  to 1.0\u00ba  until total depth (TD) was \nreached.  The Colville 5301 44-12T preferred drilling interval consisted of an eight foot zone \nlocated approximately sixteen feet into the Three Forks Formation. Stratigraphic position in the \ntarget zone was based on penetration rates, gas shows, gamma ray data and sample observations. \nThe projected target landing was to be sixteen feet into the Three Forks and was successfully \nreached prior to casing operations. Using offsets provided by Oasis representatives, projected \nporosity zones were identified as the preferred drilling areas (Figure 9).\n\nFigure 9.  Type log gamma profile from the Lindvig 1-11-3C, with target points.  \n \nSteering decisions were made by using the higher gamma, of the underlying claystone, the low \ngamma located in the middle to higher portion of the drilling zone, and the fluctuating high to \nmedium gamma located at the top of the drilling zone.  \n \nThe TD of 21,090\u2019 MD was achieved at 1720 hours CDT on August 12, 2013. The well site team \nworked well together maintaining the well bore in the desired target interval for 76% of the \nlateral, opening 10,141\u2019 of potentially productive reservoir rock. The hole was then circulated \nand reamed for completion.\n\nSUMMARY  \n \nThe Colville 5301 44-12T is a successful well in Oasis Petroleum\u2019s horizontal Three Forks \ndevelopment program in Baker Field. The project was drilled from surface casing to TD in 21 \ndays. The TD of 21,090\u2019 MD was achieved at 1720 hours CDT August 12, 2013. The well site \nteam worked well together maintaining the well bore in the desired target interval for 76% of the \nlateral, opening 10,141\u2019 of potentially productive reservoir rock. \n \nDiesel invert drilling fluid 9.5-10.1 ppg for the vertical hole and 10.15-10.4 ppg for curve \noperations were used to maintain stable hole conditions, minimize washout through the salt \nintervals and permit adequate analysis of mud gas concentrations.  \n \nSamples in the Three Forks were commonly dolomite which is tan, cream, occasional light \nbrown, rare light gray tan, trace light gray. Additionally this facies was friable and dense with an \nearthy texture. It also contained a trace of disseminated and nodular pyrite. Possible \nintercrystalline porosity was observed, as was a rare to a trace of light brown spotty oil stain. \nPresent in varying amounts was light gray to off white, rare light green shale which was friable \nto firm, sub-blocky with an earthy texture. Trace of nodular and disseminated pyrite was noted, \nand the shale contained no visible porosity. \n \nGas on the Colville 5301 44-12T varied according to penetration rates and stratigraphic position \nof the well bore. Observed concentrations of background gas ranged from 300 to 600 units, and \nconnection peaks of 1,000 to 1,200 units were observed in the middle portion of formation while \ndrilling in the lateral where shows were the best. A trip at 19,527\u2019 MD, yielded a trip gas of \n1,545 units \n \nThe Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC. Colville 5301 44-12T awaits completion operations \nto determine its ultimate production potential.  \n \nRespectfully submitted,  \n \nG.

Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits \nare prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized representative of the director prior to lining and use.  \nDrill cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings \npit.\u201d \n \nForm 1 Changes & Hard Lines  \n  Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.  \nThe proposed directional plan is at a legal location.  The minimum legal coordinate from the well head at casing \npoint is: 450\u2019 south.   Also, based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum legal coordinate from the \nwell head is: 10570\u2019 south.\n\nHeather McCowan \nMay 8, 2013 \nPage 2 \n \nLocation Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period) \n   Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the \napproved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report.   If circumstances require operations to \ncommence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may \nbe waived by the Director.  Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information \nnecessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other \ninformation that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the \ndrilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit. \n \nPermit Fee & Notification \n   Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card .The permit fee has been received.  It is requested \nthat notification be given immediately upon the spudding of the well.  This information should be relayed to the \nOil & Gas Division, Bismarck, via telephone.  The following information must be included:  Well name, legal \nlocation, permit number, drilling contractor, company representative, date and time of spudding.  Office hours are \n8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is (701) 328-8020, leave a \nmessage if after hours or on the weekend.  \n \nSurvey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells \n   NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey contractor \nshall file a certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion.  Surveys \nmust be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director may \nrequire the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the \noperation of the director's office in a timely manner.  Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe \ndocument, with a certification cover page to certsurvey@nd.gov.    \nSurvey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.  \nSpecifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve \n(or when sliding) and 90 feet in the lateral. \n \nSurface casing cement \n \nTail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12 \nhours, and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi \nbefore drilling the plug or initiating tests.   \n \nLogs \n \nNDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of (1) a suite of open hole logs from which formation tops and \nporosity zones can be determined, (2) a Gamma Ray Log run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore, and \n(3) a log from which the presence and quality of cement can be determined (Standard CBL or Ultrasonic cement evaluation \nlog) in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set, this log must be run prior to completing the well.  \nAll logs run must be submitted free of charge, as one digital TIFF (tagged image file format) copy and one digital LAS (log \nASCII) formatted copy. Digital logs may be submitted on a standard CD, DVD, or attached to an email sent to \ndigitallogs@nd.gov \n   \nThank you for your cooperation.  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nSincerely,
