The Missouri River continues to rise and the possibility of additional \nflooding from the spring melt and recent rains in the near future exists. I urge you to closely monitor \nthese sites and take the necessary preventative actions to eliminate or mitigate environmental damage \nif these sites become deluged with flood waters. The following e-mail from Allen Schlag of the National \nWeat her Service also addresses the current situation of the Missouri River in the Williston area: \n600 E Boulevard Ave - Dept 405, Bismarck, North Dakota 58505-0840 Phone (701 )328-8020 Fax (701 )328-8022"

    "text": "From: Allen Schlag [mailto:allen.schlag@noaa.gov] \nSent: Monday, May 12, 2014 1:47 PM \nTo: WILLIAMS; Samuelson, Jerry O.; MCKENZIE; Anton, Amy J.; Ackerman, Laura C.; Engelhardt, Bruce \nW.; Travnicek, Andrea J.; Johnson, Sean M. \nSubject: Missouri River \nGreetings everyone \nJust a quick note on the Missouri River near Williston forecast site and the prospects for problems as \nwe go forward into latter half of May and early June (by default this also includes the Yellowstone in \nND as well). As you may have noticed already, the Missouri River near Williston crossed over into \nForecast Issuance Stage this past weekend before falling back below 20 ft. This, is temporary. While \nthe Corps released a statement last week tempering their runoff expectations for the Missouri River \noverall, the attached graphic of mountain snowpack suggests we still have a pretty strong runoff into \nthe Yellowstone and Missouri Rivers ahead of us. \nWe will most likely cross over above flood stage as measured at the Lewis and Clark Bridge west of \nWilliston at some point in the next couple of weeks. \nWhat exactly lies in store for the area with respect to eventual river stages is still quite unclear as the \noverall environment for the melt of the mountain snowpack is too far out. However ... there has been \na fairly wet pattern in the plains of Montana already this spring, with a mixed bag in the upper \nelevations of central MT. The region remains well above normal with respect to mountain snowpack, \nbut is also well below where 1997 and 2011 were at this point in time (see the second attached pdf). \nIf I had to take a wild guess this far in advance, something around the 22.5 to 24.5 ft range is \nreasonable, with any added big rains this could be expanded quite easily to the 25-26 ft range. \nHow exactly this will compare to this spring's ice jams and high water is a really good question, which I \ndon't have any easy answers to either. Suffice to say, I think there's a pretty decent chance that we \nwill see water roughly 4-6 ft higher than is currently in northwestern ND along both the Yellowstone \nand Missouri Rivers with the timing of near the last week of May to about the third week of June. \nHistorically, I know there have been some access issues with oil well sites in the Trenton area with \nwater levels in the 22 ft range at the Lewis and Clark Bridge. How much of this has been mitigated by \nring dikes or road raises, again ... very good question to which I have no answer. \nOf course, if you have any questions or just want to chat about this in greater detail, always feel free \nto give me a call. \nAllen \np.s. And as always, feel free to disseminate as you feel is appropriate. \nAllen J. Schlag Service Hydrologist \nWFO-Bismarck \nNational Weather Service \n2301 Univ.

    "text": "> EVALUATION\nGENERAL\nThe Nance Petroleum Corporation Lewis & Clark #2-4H was designed as a\nhorizontal outpost development weil for the Nesson member of the Mississippian\nMission Canyon Formation within the Baker Field. The Baker Field is located in the\nU.S. portion of the Williston Basin, in McKenzie County, North Dakota. Due to its\nlocation on the Missouri River floodplain, a gravel pad was built up above the\nsurrounding ground elevation for the drilling of the Lewis & Clark #2-4H and any\nsubsequent wells drilled from this location. The planned bottom hole location for the\ninitial lateral in the Lewis & Clark #2-4 was north and west of the surface location. Later\nsidetracks may be added with different orientations.\nThe primary offset wells used for correlation while drilling the Lewis & Clark #2-\n4H were :\n1) the Basic Earth Science Systems, Inc. Basic Game & Fish #34-3 (now\nowned by Nance Petroleum Corp.}, with the surface location 392\u2019 FSL\n& 494' FWL in the SW SW Section 2, T153N, R101W, McKenzie Co.,\nN.D. The Basic Game & Fish was drilled directionally in late 1985 fram\na pad in the SW SW Section 2 to a bottom hole location in the SE SE\n7 Section 3. Completed in the Nesson zone of the Mission Canyon\nFormation, the original well produced 224,525 BO, 107,142 MCFG,\nand 6,623\u2019 BW through mid 2002. Nance re-entered the Basic Game\n& Fish in November of 2003 and drilled a 3,800' horizontal teg in the\nNesson. The bottom hole location of the horizontal leg was in the NE\nSW Section 3, 1,975\u2019 North and 4,338.8\u2019 West of the surface location.\nRecent production from the Nesson lateral has averaged 220 BOPD.\n2) the John L. Cox French-Pinney #24-3 (now owned by Nance\nPetroleum Corp.), located 660' FSL & 1,955\u2019 FWL in the SE SW\nSection 3, T153N, R101W, McKenzie Co.,N.D. The French-Pinney\nwas drilled in 1987 and completed in the Red River Formation\n(Ordovician in age). The French-Pinney IP\u2019d for 276 BOPD, 486\nMCFG, and 0 BWPD, and has produced over 401,537 BO, 718,456\nMCFG, and 193,009 BW from the Red River.\n3) The nearest well to the Lewis & Clark #2-4H is a dry hole drilled by\nJohn L. Cox in 1989. The Mildred #1 was located 1,325\u2019 FSL and 660\u2019\nFEL in the NE SE Section 4, T153N, R101W, McKenzie Co., N.D. The\nMildred was drilled directionally to Red River depths, reaching a\nbottom hole location 2,094.64\u2019 FSL and 642.92\u2019 FEL, still in the NE SE\nSection 4. The Mildred was plugged and abandoned after\nunsuccessfully testing the Nesson and the Red River.\nUNBURST\u00a2\nCONSULTING\nees"

The top of the Nesson was cut at a hole angle of 81 5\u00b0. The curve\nwas continued to bring the trajectory back up and leveled off in the upper Nesson\nHowever the well path drilled back out the top of the Nesson into the overlying Midale\nbefore the hole angle could be brought back to 90\u00b0 (horizontal).

Sidetrack #4 was initiated at\n10.364 MD, within the mid-Nesson show zone. Shows similar to those seen in the mid-\nNesson in Latera! #1 were seen cnce again in the early portions of Sidetrack #1. Once\nthe sidetrack nad been established the well path was steered up to the top af the\nNesson to seek better porosity development However no significant hgh porosity was\nencountered between 10 900\u2019 MD and 11,700\u2019 MD as the upper Nesson was traversed\nup and back down. The mid-Nesson was explored between 11.75C MD and 12.600\nMD. exhibiting good gas and fair sample shows. Another exploration of the upper\nNesson was made between 12 600\u2019 MD and 12.900\u2019 MD. A resistive \u201ctight streak\nseemed to be holding the well path down from reaching the top of the Nesson. After\nsignificant effort the \u201ctight streak\u201d was breached and some good porosity development\nwas discovered at the top of the Nesson. The gas readings were subdued due to the\nsiow penetration rates sliding up through the \u201ctight streak\u201d however samples looked\ngood.

The lateral exposed a net 4,380!\nfollowing the initial penetrations of the top of the Nesson. The vast majority of the\nlateral is interpreted to have been drilled within the Nesson or stratigraphically near the\nNesson. The Lewis & Clark #2-4H required 40 drilling days or approximately 584\nrotating hours. The drilling operation generally went smoothly, with few delays or\nproblems. General sample quality was rated as fair in the lateral. The show quality in\nthe lateral was poor to fair, with obvious oil staining and visible open porosity only\nevident in the mid-Nesson show zone and a thin streak at the top of the Nesson during\n- the final 900\u2019 of lateral.\nr.\nUNBURS}\n| CONSULTING\n|"

Tubing-conveyed electric logs were of significant help in devising\nthe revised targeting of the lateral and in identifying fracture density and\n\ni orientations.\n\n4) There were 5,621' measured depth drilled in the two laterals following the\ninitial penetration of the Nesson (4,380\u2019 from the initial entry point in\nLateral #1 to the end of Sidetrack #1). Of the total footage drilled (5,621')\nafter initial penetration of the Nesson: 3,926\u2019 (or 70%) were drilled in the\nNesson; 650\u00b0 (or 12%) were drilled just above the Nesson in the basal\nMidale; and 1,045\u00b0 (or 18%) were drill below the Nesson.\n\nj 5) Sample show and visual porosity estimates indicated fair hydrocarbon\nproduction potential for the lateral. Fiuid losses indicate some\npermeability. Electric iogs catculate favorably for the mid-Nesson porosity\nexposed in Lateral #1.\n\n8) The Lewis & Clark #2-4H awaits open hole completion in the Nesson\nlateral following an acid stimulation with the drilling rig after TD.\nRespectfully submitted,\nSunburst Consulting\nSUNBURST\u00ae:\nCONSULTING"

We have determined that the top of the cement behind the 7-inch casing string\nis at a depth of 4914 feet. The top of the Newcastle Formation is picked from logs at\n4891 feet, The North Dakota Administrative Code Section 43-02-03-21 requires that\nsufficient cement be used to isolate the Dakota Group, of which the Newcastle Formation\nis a part.\nSince the Newcastle Formation is not properly isolated, approval may be given\npermission to monitor the surface-production casing annulus. This approval may be\ngranted in lieu of an immediate cement squeeze, contingent upon the following\nstipulations:\n1. The surface \u2014 production casing annulus must be continuously\nmonitored with an accurate pressure gauge.\n2. The pressure gauge must not be any higher than a 300-psi gauge.\n3. All valves installed on the annulus must be exposed to the surface;\nburial will be allowed only in the presence of an NDIC Oil and Gas\nDivision Inspector.\n4, Any pressure development on the annulus must be immediately\nreported to the Oil and Gas Division.\n5. The Newcastle Formation must be isolated, as directed by the Oil and\nGas Division, upon the abandonment of the well.\n600 E Boutevard Ave Dept 405, Bismarck, North Dakota \u00a78505-0840 Phone(701)328-8020 Tax(70! 328-8022"

If that well is successful, we plan te drill the Lewis & Clark 2-4 in, January 2003, An exact well plan will be submitted prior to\nmoving in a rig, showing casing program, mud program and horizontal path.\nDate\ni hereby svear oration that tho infounatin herein proved is tue. complete and correct a\u00a2 determnad vom all avaiable records\nOctober 11, 2002\n7 CF Psmted Name [rie\n2 { > _|Gary L.

Upon completion of well, areas required for continued use will be graded to provide\ndrainage and minimize erosion. Those areas unnecessary for use will be be reclaimed\nby removing all fill dirt, scoira and the liner from lands of the United States. The\nreclaimed areas will be seeded with a grass mixture as _prescribedby the Corps of\nEngineers and the North Dakota Game and Fish Department. It is recognized that\nadditional welts may be drilled from the initial location and if the proposed well is a\nproducer, the reclamation process will not start unti! one year after first production.\nThe time period will allow the planning and drilling of one or more additional wells.\n\n5.
