It is a wildcat well positioned east of the Indian \nHill Field of Williston Basin.  Wade Federal 5300 21-30H is located approximately 7 miles \nsouth of the town of Williston, North Dakota in McKenzie County.   \n \nThe prognosis proposed a single lateral leg trending 90\u00b0 to be drilled from the SE NW corner of \nSection 30 to the SE NE of Section 29.  The lateral portion of Wade Federal 5300 21-30H \ntargeted the porous silty sandstone of the middle member of the Bakken Formation, \napproximately 12\u2019 below the top of the Upper Bakken Shale. \n \n \n \n \nOasis Petroleum Corp. USA \nWade Federal 5300 21-30H \nSW NW Sec. 30, T153N - R100WWade \n McKenzie County, North Dakota\n\nControl Wells \n \nTwo completed wells were used as control offsets for the Wade Federal 5300 21-30H. \n \nThe Verlin Fossum Et Al 26-1 [NW SE Sec. 26 T153N R101W] is a vertical well owned  by \nHarper Oil Company.  The Verlin Fossum Et Al 26- 1is located approximately 1.4 miles west of \nWade Federal 21-30H.  The initial pilot well for the Verlin Fossum Et Al 26-1 was spud on 31 \nDecember 1979.   The Verlin Fossum Et Al 26-1was drilled to the Red River Formation. \n \nThe Federal Land Bank 1-26 [NE NW Sec. 26 T153N R101W] is a dry vertical well drilled to \nthe Red River Formation by Mosbacher-Pruet Oil CO.  The Federal Land Bank 1-26  is located \napproximately 1.4 miles northwest of the Wade Federal 5300 21-30H.  Federal Land Bank 1-26 \nwas spud 16 July 1978.   \n \nDuring the curve, the gamma-ray data and e-log data from Verlin Fossum Et Al 26-1 were \nutilized to help determine proper landing depth for  Wade Federal 5300 21-30H.   \n \nA graph was constructed to determine which markers and formation tops could be accurately \nused in landing the curve.  Markers with more than 5 feet difference between the offsets were \nwatched but not utilized in decision for moving the TVD target of the curve. \n \n \nGraph1.

Gas and chromatograph levels were measured using iBall Instruments \nBloodhound (Bloodhound) real time gas detector and chromatograph system.  The Bloodhound \ngas detection system uses non-dispersive infrared and chemical sensor gas detection to evaluate \ngases liberated from the formation by the drill bit and carried to the surface by the drilling fluid. \n \nThe Bloodhound was interfaced with a Canrig electronic data recorder system. Canrig provided \nrate of penetration, on-off bottom and pump strokes to the Bloodhound and received total gas \ninformation from the Bloodhound for viewing on location and remotely. \n \nUnder the direction of RPM well site geologist, rig crews were instructed to catch lagged drill \ncutting samples at 30\u2019 intervals from 8,250 to the kick off point (KOP) at 10,172\u2019.  Samples were \ncontinuously logged at 30\u2019 intervals during the curve and throughout the lateral section. \n \nSampled drill cuttings were examined wet and dry under a binocular microscope using plain \n(broad spectrum) and transmitted light. Cuttings were evaluated for hydrocarbon \u201ccut\u201d by \nimmersion in carbo-sol (trichloroethylene) and inspection under a UV fluoroscope. 10% \nhydrochloric acid and alizarin red were used to determine the calcareous and dolomitic content \nof rocks and cementing. \n \n \nVertical Operations \n \nOverview \n \nThe Wade Federal 5300 21-30H was spud on 5 April 2011 using Nabors 149 drilling rig.  Prior \nto Rig up of RPM mud logging services, a 9 5/8\u201d hole was drilled with fresh water to \ndepth of 2,018\u2019 and isolated with 9 5/8\u201d 36# J-55 casing cemented to surface. The vertical \nborehole was drilled with bit #1 in 9 hours with an average ROP equal to 213.3 ft/hr.  Bit #2 (8 \n\u00be\u201d Smith PDC) was used to drill from 2,018\u2019 to KOP at 10,172\u2019 yielding an average ROP of \n95.8 ft/hr. \n \nRPM well site geologists arrived at site on 10 April 2011 and began logging the vertical section \nat 8,250\u2019.   \n \nDiesel invert drilling fluid with a mud weight of ranging from 9.7-10.0 ppg was used during \nremainder of the vertical hole and in the curve builds sections.  \n \nSchlumberger performed openhole electronic logging operations on 13 April 2011. \n \n \nLithology \n \nThe top of the Kibbey Lime [Mississippian Madison Group] was logged at 8,320\u2019 (-6,008\u2019), 83\u2019 \nlow to the Verlin Fossum 26-1.  Samples from this interval (Figure 1) were described as:\n\nLIMESTONE: wackestone, off white, cream, light brown, firm to hard, microcrystalline, \ncrystalline texture, common fossils fragment,  good visible porosity \n \nThe top of the Charles Salt [Mississippian Madison Group] was logged at 8,486\u2019 (-6,448\u2019), 93\u2019 \nlow to the Verlin Fossum 26-1.  The Base Last Salt was drilled at 9,655\u2019 (-6,264\u2019), 66\u2019low to the \nVerlin Fossum 26-1.  Samples from this interval (Figure 1) were described as: \n \nANHYDRITE: white, dark gray, soft, cryptocrystalline, amorphous texture \n \nLIMESTONE: mudstone, light to medium gray, soft, microcrystalline texture, \ntrace fossils fragment, very lite disseminated pyrite, no visible porosity; \ninterbedded white anhydrite in part \n \nSalt: clear, milky, translucent, crystalline, hard, euhedral to subhedral, crystalline \ntexture \n \n \nFigure 1: Photograph of  limestone, salt and anhydrite seen in sample from the Charles Formation. \nThe top of the Mission Canyon Formation of the Madison Group [Mississippian] was \npenetrated at 9,356\u2019 (-7,318), 70\u2019 low to the Verlin Fossum 26-1 (Figure 2).  Samples from this \ninterval were described as: \n \n \nLIMESTONE: mudstone to wackestone, mottled gray to brown, light gray, \nmicrocrystalline, firm to soft, earthy texture, trace sparry calcite, trace fossils fragment, \nno visible porosity, no visible oil stain;  Trace ANHYDRITE \n \nFigure 2: Photograph of limestone and anhydrite from the Mission Canyon Formation.\n\nThe top of the Lodgepole Formation of the Madison Group (Mississippian) was logged at \n9,934\u2019 (-7,896\u2019), 79\u2019 low to Verlin Fossum 26-1 (Figure 3). Samples collected from the \nLodgepole Formation were described as: \n \nLIMESTONE: mudstone, medium to light brown, cryptocrystalline to microcrystalline, \nfirm to friable, crystalline to earthy texture, trace sparry calcite, argillaceous in part, no \nvisible oil stain, no visible porosity \n \nFigure 3: Photograph of limestone from Lodgepole Formation \n \n \nDirectional Operations \n \nRPM provided equipment and personnel for directional services.  Ryan Energy Technologies \n(Ryan) provided equipment and personnel for MWD services.   RPM geologists worked closely \nwith RPM directional and Ryan MWD teams to formulate steering decisions to maximize \nexposure of borehole in the pay zone.  RPM well site geologists closely observed MWD gamma-\nray information and penetration rates to aid in steering decisions and dip degree estimations. \n \nCurve Build \n \nOverview \nBit #3 and was used in front of a 2.3\u00b0 fixed mud motor to drill the curve from measured \ndepth  10,172\u2019 to 11,023\u2019.   Bit #3, an 8 \u00be\u201d Security PDC was used to drill from 11,172\u2019 to \n11,023\u2019 in 31.5 hours generating an average ROP of 27 ft/hr.   \n \nDuring the curve progression, isopach data of gamma-ray signatures from Verlin Fossum 26-1 \nwas compared to gamma-ray readings from the MWD tool from the Base Charles Salt  (Table \n1).  Prospective markers were entered into Table 2 to determine the target landing point.  Based \non the marker pick for the Base Charles Salt, the target TVD for the curve was raised 10 feet to \n11,655\u2019 but was lowered back down to 10,670\u2019 as the curve progressed.  The curve was \ncompleted at a measured depth of 11,020\u2019and TVD of ~ 11,669\u2019.\n\nFormation  point \nVerlin Fossum \net al. 26-1 \nDist.

Intermediate casing (7\u201d) was set at measured depth 10,009\u2019 and a TVD of \n~10,669\u2019.  \n \nLithology \n \nThe top of the \u201cFalse Bakken\u201d was penetrated at a measured depth of 10,840\u2019 (TVD 10,636\u2019) (- \n8,598) suggesting a target depth of 10,668\u2019 TVD.  Gas levels remained constant through the \nFalse Bakken. \n \nThe Upper Shale of the Bakken Formation [Missippian \u2013 Devonian] was drilled at 10,876\u2019 \n(TVD 10,648\u2019) (-8,610\u2019) with sample returns of typical black, carbonaceous and petroliferous \nshale (Figure 5) characterized by gamma-ray values in excess of 250 API counts. Gas levels \nelevated to a peak of 1468 units above the average background gas of  ~70 units.  Samples were \ndescribed as: \n \nSHALE:  very dark brown, subblocky, friable, waxy texture, very slightly calcareous, visible oil \nstain, possible fracture porosity \n \n \nFigure 5: Photograph sample from the Upper Bakken Shale.\n\nThe Middle Member of the Bakken Formation was penetrated at 10,944\u2019 MD, (10,662\u2019 TVD). \nThe upper zone of the middle member contained a tight grey siltstone with little or no oil stain or \nvisible porosity (Figure 6). This \u201cZone\u201d of the Middle Bakken Formation is annotated by \u201cA\u201d on \nDiagram 1. Samples from the top of the Middle member were described as: \n \nSILTSTONE: white to off white, light gray, very fine grained, firm to friable, sub rounded \nto sub angular, vitreous, slightly to n calcareous, well sorted, poor cemented, trace \ndisseminated pyrite, trace patchy oil stain, trace intergranular porosity \n \n \nFigure 6: Photograph representative of the siltstone in the upper zone of the Middle Bakken \n \nLateral \nOverview \nDrilling fluid consisting of an open system salt water brine (9.4 \u2013 9.5 ppg) was substituted for \ndiesel invert while drilling the lateral section. one 6\u201d PDC bits was used to drill the lateral.   \n \nBit #4 (6\u201d Smith FX64D), A PDC bit in front of a 1.5\u00b0 mud motor was used to drill the entire \nlateral from 11,023\u2019 to 20,481\u2019 (TD).    Bit #4 drilled 9458\u2019 in 236.5 hours with a mean ROP of \n82.6 ft/hr. \n \nDrilling operations were concluded at 0115 hours on 23 April  2011 at a bottom hole location of \n23.03' S & 9971.67' E of surface location or approximately 2243.03' FNL & 311.76' FEL NW SE \nNW Sec. 29 T153N, R100W \n \nLithology \nTo aid in communications while drilling the lateral, a type log was created using the gamma \nsignature from The Verlin Fossum 26-1 (Diagram 1).  The target zone was an area marked \nroughly between the \u201cB\u201d and \u201cD\u201d markers on chart 1.  The attempt was made to keep the well \nbore in this region for as much of the drilling operations as possible. \n \nThe Middle Member of the Bakken Formation seen in drilling samples consisted of 2 primary \nfacies.  The upper most was the gray siltstone seen while landing the curve and described above.  \nThe second was described as sandstone interbedded with a light brown silty sandstone.  This silty\n\nsandstone consisted of a siltstone that was flaky and grey in color interbedded with a light brown \nsandstone (Figure 7).  There was a substantial amount of oil stain present in the sandstone and \nhydrocarbon cuts produced a weak diffuse cut with few streaming cuts Samples from the top of \nthe Middle Bakken member were described as: \n \nSLTY SANDSTONE: white, tan to brown, light to medium gray,  firm to friable, sub \nrounded to sub angular, moderately sorted, calcite to dolomite cement, trace \ndisseminated and nodules pyrite, vitreous texture, trace intergranular porosity, possible \nfracture porosity, moderately light brown oil stain, slightly faint white to yellow diffuse \ncut \n \nFigure 7: Photograph of silty sandstone seen in the upper part of the target zone between \u201cB\u201d and \u201cC\u201d \n \nAs the bit approached \u201cD\u201d in the middle member, silty sandstone was seen in sample (Figure 8).  \nThis silty sandstone was darker grey in color, contained much less sandstone  and held together \nwith a weaker calcite cementing.  Hydrocarbon cuts produced a weaker diffuse cut than the \nsandstone above, but still few streamers.  This silty sandstone comprised the primary target zone \nthat we were attempting to keep the well bore in (Diagram 1).   \n \n \n \n \nFigure 8: Photograph of silty sandstone from lower \u201cTarget Zone\u201d in the Middle Bakken Formation\n\nGas and Hydrocarbon Shows \n \nTotal gas levels were recorded with an average background of ~ 150 units while drilling  \nthe curve through the Lodgepole Formation.  At a measured depth of 10,520\u2019 gas levels rose \nquickly to a peak of near 1900 units and maintained a background of ~ 700 units.  Gas levels \nelevated sharply at the Upper Bakken Shale with a peak of 1450 units and an average \nbackground gas of ~ 1000 units.  Gas levels changed little after the penetration of the middle \nmember of the Bakken Formation until reaching intermediate casing point at 11,023\u2019 MD. \n \n  \nUpon exiting the show gas levels immediately rose to over 2200 units.  The gas remained \nbetween 2000 and 2200 units until after a measured depth of 11,420 when levels rose to over \n3000 units and remained at this level till the bit reach TD at a measured depth of 20,482\u2019.  The \nBloodhound gas chromatograph showed components of all C1-C4 present through the entire \nlateral (Figure 10) \n \nHydrocarbon cuts using trichloroethylene were moderate though the entire lateral. The target \nzone and above was characterized by weak white diffuse cuts and very few slow white streaming \ncuts.  No correlation was found between the strength of the hydrocarbon cuts and the position of \nthe bit in the Middle Bakken Formation \n \n \n \nFigure 9: Screen shot of Bloodhound Chromatograph showing C1-C4 present in formation gas \nof over 3000 units \n \nTotal Gas\nC1\nC2 \n \n \n \nC3 \nC4\n\nFigure 10 Photograph of flare that was produced while drilling  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDiagram 1:  Typelog created from gamma log of Verlin Fossum 26-1.

The vertical hole was drilled to a total depth (KOP) of 10,172\u2019. \n \n2) A mud program consisting of diesel invert (9.7 \u2013 9.9 ppg) after surface casing and \nthrough the curve build sections. The drilling mud was successful in maintaining stable \nhole conditions and minimizing washout through the salt intervals. Brine water with a \nweight of 9.4-9.5 ppg was used during lateral drilling operations to maintain hydrostatic \nbalance. \n \n3) One 9 5/8\u201d PDC bit was used to drill to surface casing at a depth of 2,025\u2019 in 9 hours.  One 8 \n\u00be\u201d PDC bit was used to drill the vertical hole from surface casing to KOP of 10,172\u2019 in a total of \n5.8 hours.  One 8 \u00be\u201d bits was used to drill through the curve,  landing at a measured depth of \n11,023\u2019 in 27 hours.  The entire 9,458\u2019 lateral was drilled in 82.6 hours with one 6\u201d PDC bits. \n \n4) The lateral was targeting a 10\u2019 thick section of the middle member of the Bakken \nFormation situated twenty feet below the upper shale. \n \n5) Gas levels of between 2000 and 3500 units were maintained through most of the drilling \noperations. A 4-7 foot flare was maintained though most of the drilling operations \n \n6) The Middle Bakken consisted of 2 gross lithologies.  Directly below the upper Bakken Shale, \nRPM geologists observed a dark gray/brown siltstone.  Below this siltstone, a light grey siltstone \ninterbedded with light brown oil stained sandstone.  The target zone consisted of light gray/ \nbrown porous silty sandstone.   \n \n7) Hydrocarbon cuts were moderate through the entire lateral. Few slow streaming cuts were \npresent in target zone.   \n \n8) Drilling operations were concluded at 0115 hours on 23 APR 11 at a bottom hole location \nof 23.03' S & 9971.67' E of surface location or approximately 2243.03' FNL & 311.76' FEL SE \nNW Sec. 29 T153N, R100W \n \n9) Oasis Petroleum Wade 5300 21-30H awaits completion operations to determine ultimate \nproduction potential. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRespectfully submitted, \nJoseph H Large \nRPM Consulting, Inc."

The \napproval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than \nthe 1220' setback (per Commission policy) from the north & south boundaries and 200' setback (per ICO 14498) \nfrom the east & west boundaries within the 1280 acre drilling unit consisting of Sections 29 & 30-T153N-R100W. \nPERMIT STIPULATIONS: OASIS PETROLEUM must contact NDIC Field Inspector John Axtman \nat 701-770-2564 prior to location construction. \nNew Policy \nOperators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the \napproved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to \ncommence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may \nbe waived by the Director. Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information \nnecessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of ND.AC 43-02-03-16.2 (1 ), (a)-(f), and any other \ninformation that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the \ndrilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit. \nPermit Fee & Notification \nPayment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card .The permit fee has been received. It is requested \nthat notification be given immediately upon the spudding of the well. This information should be relayed to the \nOil & Gas Division, Bismarck, via telephone. The following information must be included: Well name, legal \nlocation, permit number, drilling contractor, company representative, date and time of spudding. Office hours are \n8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time.

Surveys \nmust be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director may \nrequire the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the \noperation of the director's office in a timely manner. Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe \ndocument, with a certification cover page to certsurvey@nd.gov. \nSurvey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore. \nReserve pit \nPlease be advised that conditions may be imposed on the use and reclamation of a drilling reserve pit on \nthis site if specific site conditions warrant. \nSurface casing cement \nTail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12 \nhours, and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi \nbefore drilling the plug or initiating tests. \nLogs \nNDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of a Cement Bond Log from which the presence of \ncement can be determined in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set and a Gamma \nRay Log must be run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore. All logs must be submitted as \none paper copy and one digital copy in LAS (Log ASCII) format, or a format approved by the Director. Image \nlogs that include, but are not limited to, Mud Logs, Cement Bond Logs, and Cyberlook Logs, cannot be produced \nin their entirety as LAS (Log ASCII) files. To create a solution and establish a standard format for industry to \nfollow when submitting image logs, the Director has given approval for the operator to submit an image log as a \nTIFF (*. tif) formatted file. The TIFF (*. tif) format will be accepted only when the log cannot be produced in its \nentirety as a LAS (Log ASCII) file format. The digital copy may be submitted on a 3.5'' floppy diskette, a standard \nCD, or attached to an email sent to digitallogs@nd.gov \nThank you for your cooperation. \nSincerely, \nNathaniel Erbele \nPetroleum Resource Specialist"
