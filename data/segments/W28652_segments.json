Kline Federal 5300 41-18 10B is \nsituated within the Baker Field. A single lateral leg trending 90\u00b0 was proposed to be drilled from \nthe SW SW corner of Section 18 to the SE SE corner of Section 17 targeting the porous \nsandstone and silty sandstone of the Middle Bakken. \n \nControl Wells \n \nTwo completed wells were used as the control offsets to the Kline Federal 5300 41-18 10B.   \n \nThe primary offset considered was the Kline Federal 5300 41-18 11T2 [SW SW Sec. 18 T153N, \nR100W] which is a horizontal well drilled by Oasis Petroleum. Kline Federal 5300 41-18 11T2 \nis located approximately 33 feet south of Kline Federal 5300 41-18 10B. \n \nThe other offset considered was the Kline Federal 5300 41-18 12TX [SW SW Sec. 18 T153N, \nR100W] which is a horizontal well drilled by Oasis Petroleum. Kline Federal 5300 41-18 12TX \nis located approximately 66 feet south of Kline Federal 5300 41-18 10B. \n \nDuring the curve, the gamma ray that was produced was constantly compared to the Kline \nFederal 5300 41-18 11T2 and the Kline Federal 5300 41-18 12TX wells. Gamma ray was used \nto help determine a proper landing depth. \n \nTo assist in the choosing of the landing target, an isopach table (Table 1) was constructed to \nmeasure the distance of formation tops to the target depth determined from the Kline Federal \n5300 41-18 11T2 and Kline Federal 5300 41-18 12TX offset wells. Comparison of gamma ray \nmarkers showed the most consistent isopach for up-hole formations to be the False Bakken.\n\nTable 1:  Distance from Formation tops in the control wells were utilized to determine an initial drilling target. \n \n \n \nOperator:\nWell Name:\nLocation:\nElevation:\nKB:\n2,082'\nFormation/\nZone\nKibbey Lime\n8,382'\n-6,300'\n183'\n2,368'\nCharles Salt\n8,565'\n-6,483'\n642'\n2,185'\nBase Last Salt\n9,207'\n-7,125'\n223'\n1,543'\nMission Canyon\n9,430'\n-7,348'\n567'\n1,320'\nLodgepole\n9,997'\n-7,915'\n708'\n753'\nFalse Bakken\n10,705'\n-8,623'\n7'\n45'\nUpper Bakken Shale\n10,712'\n-8,630'\n18'\n38'\nMiddle Bakken\n10,730'\n-8,648'\n40'\n20'\nControl Well\nMcKenzie Co., ND\nOasis Petroleum\nKline Federal 5300 41-18 11T2\nSW SW Sec. 18 T153N, R100W\nEst.

Gas and chromatograph levels were measured using NOV WellSight Gas \nDetection real time gas detector and chromatograph system.  The WellSight gas detection system \nuses non-dispersive infrared and chemical sensor gas detection to evaluate gases liberated from \nthe formation by the drill bit and carried to the surface by the drilling fluid. \n \n \nThe gas detector was interfaced with a RigWatch electronic data recorder system. RigWatch \nprovided drill rate, on-off bottom and pump strokes to the gas detector and received total gas \ninformation from the gas detector for viewing on location and remotely. \n \nUnder the direction of RPM well site geologists, rig crews were instructed to catch lagged drill \ncutting samples at 30\u2019 intervals in the vertical hole and curve build from 8,350\u2019 to 11,175\u2019 MD \nand 50\u2019 samples from 11,175\u2019 to TD (20,475\u2019).  \n \nSampled drill cuttings were examined wet and dry under a binocular microscope using both plain \n(broad spectrum) and transmitted light. Cuttings were evaluated for hydrocarbon \u201ccut\u201d by \nimmersion in Acetone and inspection under a UV fluoroscope. 10% hydrochloric acid and \nalizarin red were used to determine the calcareous and dolomitic content of rocks and cementing. \n \nRPM Geologic, Inc. (RPM) well site geologists also closely examined MWD gamma-ray \ninformation and penetration rates to aid in steering decisions and dip degree estimations. \n \nVertical Operations \n \nOverview  \n \nThe Kline Federal 5300 41-18 10B was spud for surface drilling on 9 September 2014 utilizing \nNabors 486 as the drilling contractor. Prior to commencement of RPM mud logging services, a \n17 1/2\u201d hole was drilled with fresh water to depth of 2,125\u2019 and isolated with 13 3/8\u201d 54# J-55 \ncasing cemented from 2,083' to surface. To ensure hole stability a 12 \u00bc\u201d hole was drilled to a \ndepth of 6,140\u2019 and 40# 8 5/8 casing was set at 6,125\u2019. \n \nRPM well site geologists began logging the vertical interval at 8,350\u2019. \n \nTwo PDC bit were used to drill out of secondary casing casing to vertical TD. PDC bit #1 (8 \u00be\u201d \nVarel) was used to drill from 2,140\u2019 to 9,9500\u2019 and averaged an ROP of 62 ft/hr in 61.5 hours of \nuse.  A second Varel PDC bit was used to continue drilling to a vertical TD of 10,240\u2019 MD in 4.5 \nhours with an average penetration rate of 64.4 ft/hr\n\nDiesel invert drilling fluid with a mud weight ranging from 9.80-9.90 ppg was used for the \nremainder of the vertical hole and in the curve builds sections.  The vertical interval was drilled \nto a kick off point (KOP) of 10,450\u2019, at which point vertical operations were ceased. \n \nLithology \n \nThe top of the Kibbey Lime [Mississippian Madison Group] was picked at 8,376\u2019 (-6,294\u2019), 6\u2019 \nhigh to the Kline Federal 5300 41-18 11T2.  Samples from this interval (Figure 1) were \ndescribed as: \n \nLIMESTONE: wackestone, light gray to medium gray, light gray brown to \nmedium gray brown, occasional off white friable to firm,  crystalline to \nmicrocrystalline \n \n \nFigure 1: Photograph of Limestone seen in sample from the Kibby Limestone formation. \n \nThe top of the Charles Salt [Mississippian Madison Group] was logged at 8,566\u2019 (-6,484\u2019), 1\u2019 \nlow to the Kline Federal 5300 41-18 11T2. The Base Last Salt was drilled at 9,206\u2019 (-7,123\u2019), 2\u2019 \nhigh to the Kline Federal 5300 41-18 11T2. Samples from this interval (Figure 2) were described \nas: \n \nSALT: translucent, trace off white, crystalline, firm, crystalline texture, no visible \nporosity, no visible oil stain \n \nLIMESTONE: wackestone, light gray to medium gray, light gray brown to medium \ngray brown, occasional off white friable to firm,  crystalline to microcrystalline \n \n \nANHYDRITE: off white, cream, soft to firm, amorphous texture, no visible porosity\n\nFigure 2: Photograph of Salt seen in sample from the Charles formation. \n \nThe top of the Mission Canyon formation of the Madison Group [Mississippian] was reached at \n9,428\u2019 (-7,346\u2019), 2\u2019 high to the Kline Federal 5300 41-18 11T2. Samples from this interval \n(Figure 3) were described as: \n \nLIMESTONE: wackestone, light gray to medium gray, light gray brown to medium \ngray brown, occasional off white friable to firm, crystalline to microcrystalline \n \n \nFigure 3: Photograph of limestone from the Mission Canyon formation.\n\nThe top of the Lodgepole formation of the Madison Group (Mississippian) was logged at 9,980\u2019 \n(-7,898\u2019), 17\u2019 high to the Kline Federal 5300 41-18 11T2. Samples from this interval (Figure 4) \nwere described as: \n \nARGILLACEOUS LIMESTONE: wackestone, medium gray brown to light gray \nbrown, firm, crystalline texture, trace sparry calcareous, carbonaceous, possible \nintercrystalline porosity, possible slightly light brown spotty oil stain \n \n \nFigure 4: Photograph of argillaceous limestone from Lodgepole formation. \n \n \n \nDirectional Operations \n \nGyrodata provided equipment and personnel for MWD teams, while RPM Consulting provided \ndirectional personnel. RPM geologists worked closely with RPM directional as well as Gyrodata \nMWD teams to formulate steering decisions to maximize the footage of borehole in the pay \nzone. \n \nCurve Build \n \nOverview \n \nTwo PDC bits were used to build the curve section.  Bit #3 was an 8 \u00be\u201d Security bit used to drill \nthe curve from a measured depth of 10,240\u2019 to 10,859\u2019 in 17.5 hours, averaging 34.50 ft/hr. Bit \n#4 (8 \u00be\u201d Security) was used to drill the curve from a measured depth of 10,859\u2019 to 11,175\u2019 in\n\n10.5 hours, averaging 30.1 ft/hr.  7\u201d 32# P-110 casing was set to 11,037\u2019 MD upon completion of \nthe curve. \n \nA Chart was constructed for the curve (Chart 1) that compared the isopach of certain easily \nrecognizable gamma markers from the Kibbey Lime to Middle Bakken on the control well \nKline Federal 5300 41-18 11T2 and Kline Federal 5300 41-18 12TX to the Kline Federal 5300 \n41-18 10B as marker picks were made.  This chart shows the False Bakken top being very close \nin thickness to target based on the offset wells, and was the main point used to make changes to \nthe target landing depth during the curve. The curve was completed at a measured depth of \n11,175\u2019and TVD of 10,752\u2019, ~19 feet below the base of the Upper Bakken Shale. \n \n \nChart 1: Comparing distances from gamma markers on the offset wells to markers in gamma in the curve. \n \nLithology \n \nThe top of the \u201cFalse Bakken\u201d was drilled at a measured depth of 10,864\u2019 (TVD 10,708\u2019) (-\n8,626\u2019) 3\u2019 low to the Kline Federal 5300 41-18 11T2. \n \nThe Upper Shale of the Bakken formation [Mississippian \u2013 Devonian] was drilled at 10,890\u2019 \nMD (10,716\u2019 TVD) (-8,634\u2019) with sample returns of black, carbonaceous, and petroliferous shale \n(Figure 5) characterized by gamma ray values in excess of 255 API counts. The Upper Shale was \n4\u2019 lolw to the Kline Federal 5300 41-18 11T2.

The Middle Member contained layers of \nsandstone and silty sandstones with varying amounts of porosity and oil stain (Figure 6). \nSamples from the Middle Member were described as: \n \nSILTY SANDSTONE: common salt and pepper, occasional light gray to medium gray, \nvisible white, very fine grained, soft to firm, moderately to well sorted, rounded to sub \nrounded, moderately to poorly cemented, visible calcareous fluid fractures, possible \nfracture porosity, common intergranular porosity, visible light brown spotty oil stain \n \n \n Figure 6: Photograph of sandstone and silty sandstone from the middle member of the \nBakken formation.\n\nLateral \n \nOverview \n \nDrilling fluid consisting of open system salt water brine (9.6-9.7 ppg) was used while drilling the \nlateral section up to the TD of 20,475\u2019. Four 6\u201d PDC bits were used to drill the lateral. \n \nBit #5 (Varel VM613P2) was a PDC bit used to drill the start of the lateral from 11,175\u2019 to \n13,813\u2019 and averaged an ROP of 57.30 over 46 hours of use. Bit #6 (Reed) was a PDC bit used \nto drill from 13,813\u2019 to 16,761\u2019; it was used for 69  hours at an average drilling rate of 42.70 feet \nper hour. Bit #7 (Smith MDSi613) was a PDC bit used to drill from 16,761\u2019 to 19,731\u2019, and was \nused for 91 hours and averaged an ROP of 42.70 ft/hr. Bit #8 (Smith MDSi613) was a PDC bit \nused to drill from 19,731\u2019 to TD @ 20,475\u2019  \n \n \nThe Upper Bakken Shale was encountered at the measured depth 15,220\u2019. The decision was \nmade to move the bit back to 15,070\u2019 MD and sidetrack.  Time drilling began using the 5-5 4-4 \n3-3 2-2 1-1 method and once that was concluded at 15,102\u2019 MD the sidetrack was drilled to \nforward. \n \nThe Lower Bakken Shale was encountered at the measured depth 18,550\u2019. The decision was \nmade to move the bit back to 18,000\u2019 MD and sidetrack.  Time drilling began using the 5-5 4-4 \n3-3 2-2 1-1 method and once that was concluded at 18,021\u2019 MD  the sidetrack was drilled to TD. \n \n \n \nDrilling operations were concluded at 10:48 on December 31, 2014 at a bottom hole location of \n10,630.79' S & 1,109.25' E of surface location or approximately 754.45' FSL & 283.76' FEL of \nSE SE Sec. 22 T153N, R100W. \n \nLithology \n \n \n \nThe target Zone of the Middle Bakken consisted of a zone 9 to 19 feet below the Upper \nBakken Shale.  This zone consists of a silty sandstone with very intergranular porosity, \nmoderate gas, and visible oil stain (Figure 6). Samples from the target Zone were generally \ndescribed as: \n \nSILTY SANDSTONE: light to medium gray, common light brown to tan, common \nwhite to off white, very fine grained, friable to firm, moderately to well sorted, sub \nrounded to sub angular, moderately to poorly cemented, visible calcareous fluid \nfractures, trace disseminated pyrite, possible fracture porosity, common intergranular \nporosity, trace light brown spotty oil stain\n\nGas and hydrocarbon Shows \n \nIt was found that the gas and hydrocarbon shows were elevated through the entire lateral with an \naverage background gas of ~3500 units and common peaks of between 7000u and 8000u. \n \n \nThe NOV gas chromatograph showed components of all C1-C4 present through the entire lateral. \nSample cuttings throughout the lateral showed oil stain and a fast white diffuse cut when \nsubmerged in Acetone solution and observed with a UV fluoroscope. Trace oil was observed in \nthe sample wash water.\n\nSummary \n \n1) The Kline Federal 5300 41-18 10B was initially spud for surface drilling on September \n9th 2014 in the Indian Hill field of McKenzie County, North Dakota. The well was spud \nby Nabors 486 and the vertical hole was drilled to a total depth (KOP) of 10,240\u2019. \n \n2) A mud program consisted of diesel invert (9.8-9.9 ppg) after surface casing through the \ncurve build sections. The drilling mud was successful in maintaining stable hole \nconditions and minimizing washout through the salt intervals. Brine water with a weight \nof 9.6-9.7 ppg was used during lateral drilling operations to maintain hydrostatic balance \nuntil a TD of 20,475\u2019. \n \n3) Two 8 \u00be\u201d Varel PDC bit was used to drill out of surface casing to a KOP of 10,240\u2019. \nTwo 8 \u00be\u201d PDC bits were used to drill the curve to 11,175\u2019 MD. Four 6\u201d PDC bits were \nused to drill the lateral to 20,475\u2019 TD.  \n \n4) The lateral was targeting the Middle Member of the Bakken Formation member \nranging from about 9\u2019 and 19\u2019 below the base of the Upper Bakken Shale  \n \n \n5) Gas levels between 3000 and 4000 units were maintained with peaks over 8000 units \nthrough the lateral drilling operations while in the Middle Member.  \n \n6) The Middle Member of the Bakken Formation target consisted of one observed gross \nlithology. The Middle Member was observed to be a silty sandstone with lots of \ndisseminated pyrite and apparent intergranular porosity with visible oil stain. \n \n7) Trace to moderate oil stain was observed in zone associated with a fast, white, diffuse \ncut. Trace oil washed out of the samples into the wash water when they were cleaned. \n \n8) Drilling operations were concluded at 14:00 on July 8th, 2014 at a bottom hole location of \n254.45' south & 9968.39' east of surface location or approximately 754.45' FSL & \n283.76' FEL of SE SE Sec. 22, T153N-R100W. \n \n9) Oasis Petroleum\u2019s Kline Federal 5300 41-18 10B awaits completion operations to \ndetermine its ultimate production potential. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnnika Tostengard \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRPM Geologic LLC"

The \napproval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than \nthe 500' setback from the north & south boundaries and 200' setback from the east & west boundaries within the \n1280 acre spacing unit consisting of Sections 18 & 17 T153N R100W.  \n \nPERMIT STIPULATIONS: Due to the proximity of Lake Sakakawea to the well site, a dike is required \nsurrounding the entire location.  Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for \nfilter sock disposal must be maintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, and must \nremain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations are \nconducted. OASIS PETRO NO AMER must contact NDIC Field Inspector Richard Dunn at 701-770-\n3554 prior to location construction.   \n \nDrilling pit \nNDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that \u201ca pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well \ndrilling and completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will \nprevent pollution of the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits \nare prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized representative of the director prior to lining and use.  \nDrill cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings \npit.\u201d \n \nForm 1 Changes & Hard Lines  \n  Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.  \nThe proposed directional plan is at a legal location. Based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum \nlegal coordinate from the well head is: 10052\u2019 east. \n \nLocation Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period) \n   Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the \napproved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report.   If circumstances require operations to \ncommence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may \nbe waived by the Director.  Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information \nnecessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other \ninformation that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the \ndrilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit.\n\nHeather McCowan \nJune 17, 2014 \nPage 2 \n \nPermit Fee & Notification \n   Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card .The permit fee has been received.  It is requested \nthat notification be given immediately upon the spudding of the well.  This information should be relayed to the \nOil & Gas Division, Bismarck, via telephone.  The following information must be included:  Well name, legal \nlocation, permit number, drilling contractor, company representative, date and time of spudding.  Office hours are \n8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is (701) 328-8020, leave a \nmessage if after hours or on the weekend.  \n \nSurvey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells \n   NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey contractor \nshall file a certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion.  Surveys \nmust be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director may \nrequire the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the \noperation of the director's office in a timely manner.  Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe \ndocument, with a certification cover page to certsurvey@nd.gov.    \nSurvey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.  \nSpecifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve \n(or when sliding) and 90 feet in the lateral. \n \nSurface casing cement \n \nTail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12 \nhours, and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi \nbefore drilling the plug or initiating tests.   \n \nLogs \n \nNDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of (1) a suite of open hole logs from which formation tops and \nporosity zones can be determined, (2) a Gamma Ray Log run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore, and \n(3) a log from which the presence and quality of cement can be determined (Standard CBL or Ultrasonic cement evaluation \nlog) in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set, this log must be run prior to completing the well.  \nAll logs run must be submitted free of charge, as one digital TIFF (tagged image file format) copy and one digital LAS (log \nASCII) formatted copy. Digital logs may be submitted on a standard CD, DVD, or attached to an email sent to \ndigitallogs@nd.gov \n   \nThank you for your cooperation.  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nSincerely,

\nRE:  Filter Socks and Other Filter Media \n \n \n \n \nLeakproof Container Required \n \n \n \n \nOil and Gas Wells \n \nDear Operator, \n \nNorth Dakota Administrative Code Section 43-02-03-19.2 states in part that all waste material associated with \nexploration or production of oil and  gas must be properly disposed of in an authorized facility in accord with all \napplicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations. \n \nFiltration systems are commonly used during oil and gas operations in North Dakota.  The Commission is very \nconcerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry. \n \nEffective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the \nwell is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations \nare conducted.  The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an \nauthorized facility.  Such containers must be: \n\uf0b7 \nleakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container \n\uf0b7 \ncovered to prevent precipitation from entering the container \n\uf0b7 \nplacard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container \n \nIf the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but \nonly upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request. \n \nAs previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01 \nstates in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production \nwastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste \nManagement.  Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the \nsolid waste program.  Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud, \ninvert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.  \n \nThank you for your cooperation.  \n \n \n \nSincerely, \n \n \n \nBruce E.
