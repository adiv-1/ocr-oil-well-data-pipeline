Gamma patterns were compared with \nthe offset log and a TVD log was created while landing the curve to in order to land in \nthe targeted zone.  Steering in the lateral was accomplished by calculating dip from \nrelevant gamma markers, as well as by using lithology, total gas and ROP to determine \nour position within the formation. \n \n2.1.2 Gamma and Surveys \n \nGamma and survey MWD services were provided by Schlumberger/Pathfinder.  The \nmajority of the well was drilled within the target area of the Middle Bakken.   \n \n2.2 Mud Logging (Columbine Logging, Inc.) \n \n2.2.1 Sample Examination \n \nSamples were collected every 30 ft in the straight hole and build section, and every 30 ft \nwhile drilling the lateral. Descriptions included; mineralogy, color, firmness, argillaceous \ncontent, structure, texture, allochems, porosity, oil stain, and hydrocarbon fluorescence. \nCarbonate identification was determined with 10% dilute HCl-, alizarin red and \ncalcimeter. Hydrocarbon fluorescence was determined using a fluoroscope with a UV \nlamp.   \n \n2.2.2 Gas Detection \n \nGas was logged using a Bloodhound total gas/chromatograph system. The gas detection \nsystem uses an infra-red detector to measure total gas and the chromatograph separates \nand measures gases C1, C2, C3, iC4 and nC4. Gas was recorded in units where 1 unit \nequals 100 ppm. The gas detection system measured gases: C1, C2, C3, IC4, NC4, H2S, \nO2 and CO2."

    "text": "The Bloodhound Gas Detection and Chromatograph system use digital signal processing \ntechniques and non-dispersive infrared and chemical sensors for gas detection.  The \nsystem uses a proprietary chromatograph, which has the capability to detect from 0 to \n10,000 gas units.  This translates as 0 to 100% typical naturally-occurring hydrocarbon \ngas mixtures.  Calibration is performed using National Institute of Standards and \nTechnology (NIST) traceable calibration gases.  Lab calibration points include 0%, 2.5%, \nand 100% pure methane.  Complete immunity to saturation or damage in the presence of \nhigh concentrations of both light and heavy hydrocarbon gases precludes the necessity of \nconstant re-calibration or zero referencing. This allows the Bloodhound to react to \nhydrocarbon based gases from zero to 100% in concentration without dilution. \n \nLag time was approximated from a calculation of annular velocity based on: pump \noutput, open-hole diameter, cased hole diameter, collar diameter, drill pipe diameter and \nbottom hole assembly. Connection gases were monitored to confirm lag time calculations \nand thereby adjust lag time when needed. \n \n3.0 GEOLOGY \n \n3.1 Formation Tops Formation tops were picked using ROP, lithology, and gamma ray to identify markers in the \ncurve and lateral (Table 3.1).  \nFORMATION TOPS \nFormation/Marker Beds \nACTUAL \nPrognosis \nVertical Section \nTop MD (ft) \nTop TVD (ft) \nTHICKNESS (ft) \nDifference (ft) \nTVD KB/DF(ft) \nTVDSS \n(ft) \nKibbey Lime \n8352 \n8351 \n144 \n-4 \n8347 \n-6270 \nCharles Salt \n8496 \n8495 \n676 \n-4 \n8491 \n-6414 \nBase Last Salt \n9172 \n9171 \n216 \n-3 \n9168 \n-7091 \nMission Canyon \n9388 \n9387 \n547 \n-3 \n9384 \n-7307 \nLodgepole \n9935 \n9934 \n738 \n-2 \n9932 \n-7855 \nFalse Bakken \n10786 \n10672 \n8 \n-7 \n10665 \n-8588 \nUpper Bakken Shale \n10807 \n10680 \n18 \n-5 \n10675 \n-8598 \nMiddle Bakken \n10868 \n10698 \n~34 \n-4 \n10694 \n-8617 \nMiddle Bakken (Top of Target) \n10866 \n10706 \nn/a \n-4 \n10702 \n-8625 \nMiddle Bakken (Base of target) \n10866 \n10717 \nn/a \n-4 \n10713 \n-8636 \nLower Bakken Shale \n10866 \n10730 \n~11 \n-4 \n10726 \n-8649 \nTable 3.1 Wade Federal 5300 31-30 2B Formation Tops \n \n3.2 Lithology \nSample analysis began at 8,000\u2019 MD in the Otter Formation.   \n \n3.3 Formation Dip \nThe formation had an average dip of 89.4\u03bf.   \n \n3.4 Shows \nThe vertical-build section was drilled with invert mud and the lateral was drilled with \nbrine/production water.

The primary pay zone was 20\u2019 \nunder the bottom of the Upper Bakken Shale. This pay zone was picked for its production \npotential and quality of reservoir rock. The objective was to steer the well within the \ndefined pay zone and within the legal requirements of the state.  \n \nThe primary objective was to stay near the middle gamma markers which marks the inter \nlayering between dolomitic siltstone and limy sandstones. Gamma patterns were \ncompared with the offset log and a TVD log was created while landing the curve to in \norder to land in the targeted zone.  Steering in the lateral was accomplished by calculating \ndip from relevant gamma markers, as well as by using lithology, total gas and ROP to \ndetermine our position within the formation. \n \nThe formation had an average dip of 89.4\u03bf. (see pg. 5, fig 4.1 for a detailed formation dip \nprofile).  \n \nCurrently the well is awaiting completion. \n \n________________________________________________________________________ \n \n \nHeather Coutts, Well-Site Geologist \nColumbine Logging, Inc. \n9844 Titan Ct.

Oasis intends to drill the surface hole with freshwater based drilling mud and set surface casing with a \nsmall drilling rig and move off within 3 to 5 days. The casing will be set at a depth pre-approved by the NDIC per the \nApplication for Permit to Drill NDAC 43-02-03-21. No saltwater will be used in the drilling and cementing operations \nof the surface casing. Once the surface casing Is cemented, a plug or mechanical seal will be placed at the top of the \ncasing to prevent any foreign matter from getting into the well. A rig capable of drilling to TD will move onto the \nlocation within the 90 days previously outlined to complete the drilling and casing plan as per the APO. The \nundersigned states that this request for suspension of drllling operations in accordance with the Subsection 4 of \nSection 43-02-03-55 of the NDAC, Is being requested to take advantage of the cost savings and time savings of using \nan initial rig that is smaller than the rig necessary to drill a well to total depth but is not intended to alter or extend \nthe terms and conditions of, or suspend any obligation under, any oil and gas lease with acreage in or under the \nspacing or drilling unit for the above-referenced well. Oasis understands NDAC 43-02-03-31 requirements regarding \nconfidentiality pertaining to this permit. The lined reserve pit will be fenced immediately after construction If the well \npad is located in a pasture (NDAC 43-02-03-19 & 19.1). Oasis will plug and abandon the well and reclaim the well site \nif the well is not drilled by the larger rotary rig within 90 days after spudding the well with the smaller drilling rig. \nCompany \n!Telephone Number \nOasis Petroleum North America, LLC \n(281) 404-9562 \nFOR STATE USE ONLY \nAddress \n1001 Fannin, Suite 1500 \n0 Received \nI D Approved \nCity \n!State \nIZip Code \nHoust.on \nTX \n77002 \nDate \nS i~tU re -;' :-.. \n(:._ I \n.~ ~F \n.\u00b5\"\"\".,.,.,-\nPrinted Name \n/' . . \n, \n),{ \n_;, / ,, /.::\u00b7/ \nLauri M.

The approval is granted on the \ncondition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than the 500' setback from the north & south boundaries \nand 200' setback from the east & west boundaries within the 1280 acre spacing unit consisting of Sections 29 & 30 T153N R100W.  Tool \nerror is not required pursuant to order. \n \nPERMIT STIPULATIONS: Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for filter sock disposal must be \nmaintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-\nback whenever filtration operations are conducted.  Due to drainage adjacent to the well site, a dike is required surrounding the \nentire location.  OASIS PETROLEUM NORTH AMERICA LLC must take into consideration NDAC 43-02-03-28 (Safety \nRegulation) when contemplating simultaneous operations on the above captioned location.  Pursuant to NDAC 43-02-03-28 \n(Safety Regulation) \u201cNo boiler, portable electric lighting generator, or treater shall be placed nearer than 150 feet to any \nproducing well or oil tank.\u201d  OASIS PETRO NO AMER must contact NDIC Field Inspector Richard Dunn at 701-770-3554 \nprior to location construction. \n \nDrilling pit \nNDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that \u201ca pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well drilling and completion \noperations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will prevent pollution of the land surface and \nfreshwaters.

The Commission is very \nconcerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry. \n \nEffective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the \nwell is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations \nare conducted.  The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an \nauthorized facility.  Such containers must be: \n\uf0b7 \nleakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container \n\uf0b7 \ncovered to prevent precipitation from entering the container \n\uf0b7 \nplacard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container \n \nIf the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but \nonly upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request. \n \nAs previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01 \nstates in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production \nwastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste \nManagement.  Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the \nsolid waste program.  Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud, \ninvert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.  \n \nThank you for your cooperation.  \n \n \n \nSincerely, \n \n \n \nBruce E. Hicks \n \n \nAssistant Director"
