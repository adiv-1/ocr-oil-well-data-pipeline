The primary pay \nzone extended from 13\u2019-24\u2019 below the top of the Three Forks. This pay zone was picked \nfor its production potential and quality of reservoir rock. The objective was to steer the \nwell within the defined pay zone and within the legal requirements of the state. \nDirectional drilling was performed by RPM and MWD services were performed by Ryan \nDirectional Services.

    "text": "3 \n \n2.0 SERVICES \n \n2.1 Well site Geology (Columbine Logging, Inc.) \n \nGeological consulting and mud logging started on 1/19/2015. Services provided included; \nmorning reports, evening reports, noon and midnight reports, sample examination, \nsample recording via pictures, production of vertical and horizontal mudlog, geo steering, \nsample collection and bagging, sample mailing and a final end of well report. \n \n2.1.1 Geosteering \n \nOur primary offset GR TVD log was the Gramma Federal 5300 41-31 31T well, located \n33\u2019 south on the same pad.  From this offset log the Three Forks was determined to be \napproximately 26\u2019 feet thick.  Within the Three Forks, the primary objective was to stay \nwithin an 6\u2019 thick target window within the Three Forks \u201cA\u201d unit, which extended from \n13\u2019 to 26\u2019 below the top of the Three Forks. Gamma patterns were compared with the \noffset log and a TVD log was created while landing the curve to in order to land in the \ntargeted zone.  Steering in the lateral was accomplished by calculating dip from relevant \ngamma markers, as well as by using lithology, total gas and ROP to determine our \nposition within the formation. \n \n2.1.2 Gamma and Surveys \n \nGamma and survey MWD services were provided by Ryan Directional Services.  The \nupper 13\u2019 of the Three Forks, referred to as the \u201cB\u201d unit, consisted of overall high gamma \ncompared to the \u201cA\u201d unit.  The highest gamma readings of 170 api were just above the \ntarget line.  The top of the \u201cA\u201d was marked by a gamma peak of approximately 120 api.  \nThe \u201cA\u201d unit extended from 14\u2019 to 26\u2019 below the upper shale. The upper portion of the \n\u201cA\u201d consisted of lower gamma readings of 55 \u2013 85 api. \nThe \u201cA\u201d unit was expected to extend from 14\u2019 to 26\u2019 below the top of the Three Forks, \nbased on an offset Three Forks well on the same pad.  The 13T wellbore dropped into the \nclaystone, confirming the basic thickness of the zone.  The base of the \u201cA\u201d had a clean \nsection of gamma, followed by the Claystone 1.  After landing the curve, the wellbore \nwas drilled almost entirely within the \u201cB\u201d and \u201cA\u201d units."

    "text": "4 \n \n2.2 Mud Logging (Columbine Logging, Inc.) \n \n2.2.1 Sample Examination \n \nSamples were collected every 30 ft in the straight hole and build section, and every 30 ft \nwhile drilling the lateral. Descriptions included; mineralogy, color, firmness, argillaceous \ncontent, structure, texture, allochems, porosity, oil stain, and hydrocarbon fluorescence. \nCarbonate identification was determined with 10% dilute HCl-, alizarin red and \ncalcimeter. Hydrocarbon fluorescence was determined using a fluoroscope with a UV \nlamp.   \n \n \n2.2.2 Gas Detection \n \nGas was logged using a Bloodhound total gas/chromatograph system. The gas detection \nsystem uses an infra-red detector to measure total gas and the chromatograph separates \nand measures gases C1, C2, C3, iC4 and nC4. Gas was recorded in units where 1 unit \nequals 100 ppm. The gas detection system measured gases: C1, C2, C3, IC4, NC4, IC5, \nNC5, H2S, O2 and CO2.  \n \nThe Bloodhound Gas Detection and Chromatograph system use digital signal processing \ntechniques and non-dispersive infrared and chemical sensors for gas detection.  The \nsystem uses a proprietary chromatograph, which has the capability to detect from 0 to \n10,000 gas units.  This translates as 0 to 100% typical naturally-occurring hydrocarbon \ngas mixtures.  Calibration is performed using National Institute of Standards and \nTechnology (NIST) traceable calibration gases.  Lab calibration points include 0%, 2.5%, \nand 100% pure methane.  Complete immunity to saturation or damage in the presence of \nhigh concentrations of both light and heavy hydrocarbon gases precludes the necessity of \nconstant re-calibration or zero referencing. This allows the Bloodhound to react to \nhydrocarbon based gases from zero to 100% in concentration without dilution. \n \nLag time was approximated from a calculation of annular velocity based on: pump \noutput, open-hole diameter, cased hole diameter, collar diameter, drill pipe diameter and \nbottom hole assembly. Connection gases were monitored to confirm lag time calculations \nand thereby adjust lag time when needed."

The \nwell was drilled to completion at 17:30 hours, 3/02/2015.  The projected bottom hole \nlocation is: SE SE SEC 32, T153N, R100W, McKenzie County, North Dakota, with a \nprojected TVD of 10,932.98\u2019. \n \nThe targeted pay zone for the wellbore was a window within the Three Forks first bench.  \nThis window extended from 13\u2019 to 24\u2019 below the top of the Three Forks. The anticipated \ndip of the formation was 0.5 degrees down overall, with a possibly dip reversal structure \nbetween 16000\u2019 MD and 17500\u2019 MD.  Anticipated dip was based on a subsurface \nstructure map provided by Oasis Petroleum, and nearby laterals. Our primary offset GR \nTVD log was from the Gramma Federal 5300 41-31 31T, located on the same pad, 33\u2019 to \nthe south. From this offset log the Three Forks was determined to be approximately 26\u2019 \nfeet thick \n \nThe formation had an average dip of 89.6 degrees.  The anticipated dip reversal was \nencountered. We did see a flattening to 90.1 degrees between 16000\u2019 and 17500\u2019.  Gas \nreadings and oil shows were best in the lower 5\u2019-6\u2019 of the Three Forks \u201cA\u201d.   \n \nCurrently the well is awaiting completion. \n \n________________________________________________________________________ \n \n \nMark Miller, Adam Harris, Well-Site Geologists \nColumbine Logging, Inc. \n602 S.

Also, OASIS PETROLEUM NORTH AMERICA LLC must contact NDIC Field Inspector \nRichard Dunn at 701-770-3554 prior to location construction. \n \nDrilling pit \nNDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that \u201ca pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well \ndrilling and completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will \nprevent pollution of the land surface and freshwaters.

The Commission is very \nconcerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry. \n \nEffective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the \nwell is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations \nare conducted.  The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an \nauthorized facility.  Such containers must be: \n\uf0b7 \nleakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container \n\uf0b7 \ncovered to prevent precipitation from entering the container \n\uf0b7 \nplacard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container \n \nIf the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but \nonly upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request. \n \nAs previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01 \nstates in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production \nwastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste \nManagement.  Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the \nsolid waste program.  Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud, \ninvert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.  \n \nThank you for your cooperation.  \n \n \n \nSincerely, \n \n \n \nBruce E.
