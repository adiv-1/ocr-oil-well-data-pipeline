The \nhorizontal well was reentered on December 12, 2014 and represents a continuation of Oasis \nPetroleum\u2019s development of the Three Forks Formation within Baker Field. The Wade Federal \n5300 31-30 11T was planned to drill an approximately 9,612\u2019 lateral along a proposed azimuth \nof 86.92\u00b0. The well bore will be enhanced for production by multistage fracture stimulation. \n \nOFFSET CONTROL INFORMATION \n \nThe Oasis Wade Federal 5300 21-30 12T [SW NW Section 30, T153N, R100W] is located \napproximately 0.33 miles north of the subject well on the same pad as the other two offset wells. \nThe Oasis Wade Federal 5300 21-30 12T was spud on the 30th of September 2014. The Oasis \nWade Federal 5300 21-30 13B was spud on the 26th of September 2014. The Oasis Wade \nFederal 5300 21-30 14T2 [SW NW Section 30, T153N, R100W] was spud on the 28th of \nSeptember, 2014.\n\nFigure 2:  Offsetting control wells in relation to the Wade Federal 5300 31-30 11Twell. \n \nGEOLOGIC EVALUATION \n \nMethods: \n \nGeologic supervision of the Wade Federal 5300 31-30 11T was provided by Sunburst \nConsulting, Inc. with two well site geologists. A digital gas detector and chromatograph were \ninterfaced with a Pason electronic data recorder system. The unit of measure for gas on this well \nwas units (u), which was defined as 100 units equaling 1% methane equivalent in air. The EDR \nprovided drill rate, on-off bottom and pump strokes to the gas detection computer and received \ntotal gas information from Sunburst for viewing around location. Lagged samples were caught \nby the rig crew in 30\u2019 intervals from 4,600\u2019 MD to 10,870\u2019 MD, 10\u2019 intervals from 10,870\u2019 MD \nto 11,080\u2019 MD, and 30\u2019 intervals from 11,080\u2019 MD to 20,500\u2019 TD. Wet and dry cuttings were \nexamined under a tri-ocular microscope and complete lithologic descriptions and sampling \nintervals are provided in the lithology document within this evaluation. The set of dry cuttings \ncollected during the duration of the well were sent to the State of North Dakota. Evidence of \nlight hydrocarbons present in the drilling fluid was reported by the gas chromatography \nequipment and documented on the mud log presented with this report. \n \nZones of Interest: \n \nThe Mission Canyon Formation (Mississippian; Madison Group) was drilled at 9,364\u2019 TVD       \n(-7,310\u2019) and is comprised largely of light gray lime mudstone followed by gray to tan earthy \ntextured argillaceous lime mudstone. Shows within the Mission Canyon ranged from 15 to 100 \nunits against 9.8 ppg mud.  \nMap By Clay Hargett \nOasis Petroleum North America\n\nFigure 3 & 4:  Wet cutting of the Lodgepole Formation (left) and False Bakken sub-interval (right) at 10X.  \n \nThe top of the Lodgepole Formation was logged at 9,921\u2019 TVD (-7,867\u2019).  In general the \nLodgepole can be described as a medium to dark gray brown argillaceous lime mudstone with a \ncrystalline texture and trace amounts of disseminated pyrite (Figure 3). The False Bakken \n(Carrington Shale), drilled at 10,648\u2019 TVD (-8,594\u2019), is comprised of very dark brown to black, \nslightly pyritic shale with an earthy texture, and was found to be soft to firm (Figure 4). Strong \nhydrocarbon shows in the lower 100\u2019 of the Lodgepole were as high as 158 total gas units; \nsuggest that some of the oil and gas from the Upper Bakken Shale may be exploiting fractures \nthought to exist in the Lower Lodgepole.   \n \nThe Bakken Formation (Devonian \u2013 Mississippian) has four formal members, an upper and \nlower black, fissile, organic-rich pyritic shale, separated by an arenaceous limestone, siltstone \nand silty sandstone middle member. These three members overlay a silty shale or siltstone of the \nPronghorn Member toward the basin depositional center. The Upper Bakken Shale was drilled at \n10,656\u2019 TVD (-8,602\u2019) with sample returns typically described as black, carbonaceous, \npetroliferous shale with trace amounts of disseminated pyrite (Figure 5). The Middle Bakken, \npenetrated at 10,673\u2019 TVD (-8,619\u2019), consists of a varying thickness and sequence of interbedded \nsiltstone, limestone and silty sandstone. Trace spotty light brown oil staining was present along \nwith gas shows as high as 456 TGU. This light brown spotty oil staining was common. \nPenetrated at 10,711\u2019 TVD (-8,657\u2019), the Lower Bakken Shale was described as a black to dark \nbrown carbonaceous shale with trace amounts of disseminated pyrite (Figure 6). Gas shows \nencountered in the Lower Bakken read as high as 1356u (C1-C4). The Pronghorn was penetrated \nat 10,718\u2019 TVD (-8,664\u2019) and is commonly described as a dark to medium gray siltstone with \ncalcite cement. \n \n \n \nFigure 5 & 6: Wet cuttings of the Upper Bakken Shale (left), Lower Bakken Shale (right) at 10X.\n\nThe Three Forks Formation (Devonian; Kaskaskia Sequence.) represents a regressive sequence \ndeposited in a supratidal sabkha environment. The top of the Three Forks was drilled at 10,736\u2019 \nTVD (-8,682\u2019) and is comprised of a light to medium gray, cream to off white sucrosic dolomite \nwith trace to occasional amounts of disseminated pyrite and light green shale also with trace \namounts of disseminated pyrite (Figure 8). Shows within the Three Forks Formation ranged from \n50 to 431 units in a drilling mud of 9.6-9.9 ppg. \n \n \n \nFigure 7 & 8: Wet cuttings of the Three Forks dolomite and shale (left and right) at 10X.  \n \nGeo-steering: \n \nKick-off point for the curve was established from the isopach of the \u201cbase last salt\u201d marker \nto the Three Forks \u201ctarget\u201d in the offset wells. The Chalmers 5300 31-30 12T was used as the \nprimary offset through the vertical and curve sections. While drilling the curve, measured \ngamma ray signatures were compared to those of the three offsets and aided in the landing of \nthe curve. The landing target was confirmed by the depth of the False Bakken, which was \nconsistent with the offset wells. The curve was successfully landed within the Three Forks \nFormation at a depth of 11,080\u2019 MD (10,753\u2019 TVD) placing the well bore approximately 17\u2019 \nbelow the top of the Three Forks Formation.  Directional tools were then pulled out of the \nhole and a string of 7\u201d casing was set (11,060\u2019 MD) and then cemented by Schlumberger.  \n \nSamples from the target zone varied in porosity, oil staining, color, cementation, and pyrite \ncontent. Stratigraphic location in the target zone was based on these sample observations \nalong with gas shows, drill rates and gamma ray values. Severe doglegs were to be avoided \nso as to obtain the desired vertical section and aid in a successful completion liner run at TD.  \n \nThe Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC prospect geologist defined the  an initial target \nzone as an 10\u2019 zone that began 18\u2019 below the top of the Three Forks Formation and ended at \nthe claystone member 28\u2019 below the Three Forks Formation. The upper target zone consisted \nof a dolomite and shale interval reading 90-120 count gamma (A marker).  The center of the \ntarget interval was comprised of a warmer dolomite with greater amounts of shale reading \n100-140 count gamma (B marker). The base of the target zone was characterized by a clean \ndolomite with trace amounts of shale with gamma readings of 35-90 (C marker). The A-C \ngamma markers were used for determining depth within the target interval and plotted on the \nWade Federal 5300 31-30 11T dip profile (Figure 10).\n\nFigure 9:  Offset gamma ray profile of the upper Three Forks (0-100 api. scale) *See dip profile \n(Figure 10) for marker presentation* \n \nUsing the aforementioned information gathered during drilling, offset log information and \nthe structural data provided from Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC., well site geologists \nwere able to anticipate, and interpret the local apparent dip during the drilling of the Wade \nFederal 5300 31-30 11T well. A total depth of 20,500\u2019 MD was reached on January 18, 2015 \nat 13:45 CDT. The target resultant was 100% within the Three Forks Formation. The \nresulting structure of the Three Forks was a drop in TVD of 86.80\u2019 over 9,525\u2019 MD; \nresulting in an overall down dip of 0.52\u00ba as portrayed on the Wade Federal 5300 31-30 11T \ndip profile (Figure 10). \n \n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n140\n160\n180\n200\n220\n240\n260\n280\n300\n10700\n10710\n10720\n10730\n10740\n10750\n10760\n10770\n10780\n10790\n10800\n10810\n10820\n10830\n10840\n10850\n10820\n11320\n11820\n12320\n12820\n13320\n13820\n14320\n14820\n15320\n15820\n16320\n16820\n17320\n17820\n18320\n18820\n19320\n19820\n20320\nWellbore\nLower Bakken\nPronghorn\nThreeforks\nTop of Zone\nCenter of Zone\nClaystone\nGamma\nDIP PROFILE\nE\nW\nDepth (TVD)\nGamma\nMeasured Depth\nOasis Petroleum North America, LLC\nWade Federal 5300 31-30 11T\nLot 3 Sec. 30, T153N, R100W\nMckenzie County, ND\nEst dip = -1.07\u00b0\nEst dip = -1.24\u00b0\nEst dip = -0.73\u00b0\nEst dip = -0.60\u00b0\nEst dip = -0.67\u00b0 Est dip = -0.03\u00b0\nEst dip = -0.39\u00b0\nEst dip = -0.44\u00b0\nGross apparent dip = -0.52\u00b0\n \nFigure 10: Well profile representing estimated dip value & gamma ray for the Wade Federal 5300 31-30 \n11Tlateral.\n\nHydrocarbons: \n \nGas monitoring and fluid gains were monitored to evaluate the viability of this reservoir during \nthe drilling of the Wade Federal 5300 31-30 11T well. In the invert mud system, hydrostatic \nconditions were maintained near balance. This allowed for gas and fluid gains from the well to \nbe monitored. Gas shows were encountered in vertical, curve and lateral drilling of the well.  \n \n Background gas observed during the drilling of the lateral ranged from 50 to 120 units. Invert \ndrilling fluid was used throughout the drilling of the vertical and curve weighing 9.8-10.0 ppg. \nThe lateral was drilled with saline drilling fluid with a mud weight of 9.6-9.9 ppg. Gas shows \nranged up to 438 units and connection gases were observed up to 359 units. C1-C4 gas \ncomponents were observed throughout the course of the lateral. Trip gases were observed as high \nas 1,482 units. Oil shows were very light throughout the lateral ranging from 0-3% in sample. \nWhen present it was a light brown spotty oil stain that yielded a slow to moderate streaming to \ndiffuse light green cut fluorescence. \n \n \nSUMMARY \n \nThe Nabors B25 drilling rig successfully drilled a two-section horizontal well bore within the \nThree Forks Formation at the Wade Federal 5300 31-30 11T. A net of 9,525\u2019 was drilled within \nthe Three Forks. A mud program consisting of diesel invert (9.8 \u2013 10.0 ppg), during the vertical \nand curve build sections, and salt water based mud (9.6 -9.9 ppg), during the lateral maintained \nstable hole conditions and permitted adequate analysis of gas concentrations.  \n \nProjections of dip were successfully used to maintain the well bore in the Three Forks Formation \ntarget zone for 86% of the lateral. Samples from the target consisted of a light to medium gray, \ncream to off white dolomite with trace to occasional amounts of disseminated pyrite and \nlight green shale also with trace amounts of disseminated pyrite. Intercrystalline porosity was \ngenerally seen throughout the entire lateral. Hydrocarbon shows in the target zone were high \nthroughout the lateral. Samples from the ideal zone contained a spotty light brown oil stain.  \n \nThe Wade Federal 5300 31-30 11T will be fitted with a 4 \u00bd\u201d production liner and swell packers \nin preparation for a fracture stimulation that will determine the true commercial value of the \nwell. The well currently awaits fracture stimulation. \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \nHannah Thatcher \nDaniel Haynes \n Sunburst Consulting, Inc. \nJanuary 18, 2015"

Oasis Petroleum North America LLC intends to drill the surface hole with \nfreshwater based drilling mud and set surface casing with a small drilling rig and move off within 3 to 5 days. The \ncasing will be set at a depth pre-approved by the NDIC per the Appllcatlon for Permit to Drill NDAC 43-02-03-21. No \nsaltwater will be used in the drilling and cementing operations of the surface casing. Once the surface casing Is \ncemented, a plug or mechanical seal will be placed at the top of the casing to prevent any foreign matter from getting \nInto the well. A rig capable of drilling to TD will move onto the location within the 90 days previously outlined to \ncomplete the drilling and casing plan as per the APO. The undersigned states that this request for suspension of \ndrilling operations In accordance with the Subsection 4 of Section 43-02-03-55 of the NDAC, is being requested to \ntake advantage of the cost savings and time savings of using an initial rig that Is smaller than the rig necessary to \ndrill a well to total depth but Is not Intended to alter or extend the terms and conditions of, or suspend any obligation \nunder, any oil and gas lease with acreage In or under the spacing or drilling unit for the above-referenced well. Oasis \nPetroleum North America LLC understands NDAC 43-02-03\u00b731 requirements regarding confidentiality pertaining to \nthis permit. The drilling pit will be fenced immediately after construction if the well pad Is located in a pasture (NDAC \n43-02-03-19 & 19.1). Oasis Petroleum North America LL will plug and abandon the well and reclaim the well site if the \nwell ls not drilled by the larger rotary rig within 90 days after spudding the well with the smaller drilling rig. \nCompany \nOasis Petroleum North America LLC \nAddress \n1001 Fannin, Suite 1500 \nAssistant \nEmail Address \nccovington oasispetroleum.com \nPrinted Name \nState \nTX \nChelsea Covin ton \nDate \nNovember 3, 2014 \nZip Code \n77002 \nFOR STATE USE ONLY \nD Received \n~Approved \nDate \nBy \nTille \nENGINEERING TECHNICIAN"

All BOP drills and tests will be recorded in the IADC driller's log. \nChoke Manifold Equipment: \nAll choke lines will be straight lines. Whenever possible a turns, tee blocks will be used or will be targeted \nwith running tees, and will be anchored to prevent whip and vibration. \nAccumulator System and Location of Hydraulic Controls: \nThe accumulator will have sufficient capacity to open the hydraulically controlled choke line valve (if so \nequipped), close all rams plus the annular preventer, and retain a minimum of 200 psi above pre-charge \non the closing manifold without the use of the closing unit pumps. The fluid reservoir capacity will be \ndouble the accumulator capacity and the fluid level will be maintained at the manufacturer's \nrecommendations. The BOP system will have two (2) independent power sources to close the \npreventers. Nitrogen bottles (3 minimum) will be one (1) of these independent power sources and will \nmaintain a charge equal to the manufacturer's specifications. \nThe accumulator pre-charge pressure test will be conducted prior to connecting the closing unit to the \nBOP stack and at least once every six (6) months thereafter. The accumulator pressure will be corrected \nif the measured pre-charge pressure is found to be above or below the maximum or minimum limits \nspecified in Onshore Oil & Gas Order Number 2. \nAuxiliary Equipment: \nA) \nMud logger with gas monitor -8273' (200' above Charles Salt to Intermediate TD) \nB) \nChoke manifold with one manual and one hydraulic operated choke \nC) \nFull opening floor valve with drill pipe thread \nD) \nUpper and lower Kelly cock \nE) \nShale shakers and possible mud cleaner. \nMiscellaneous Information: \nNabors B25 is being considered to be used at the proposed location.

The approval is granted on the \ncondition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than the 500' setback from the north & south boundaries \nand 200' setback from the east & west boundaries within the 1280 acre spacing unit consisting of Sections 29 & 30 T153N R100W.  Tool \nerror is not required pursuant to order. \n \nPERMIT STIPULATIONS:  Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for filter sock disposal must \nbe maintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and \nflow-back whenever filtration operations are conducted.  OASIS PETROLEUM NORTH AMERICA LLC must take into \nconsideration NDAC 43-02-03-28 (Safety Regulation) when contemplating simultaneous operations on the above captioned \nlocation.  Pursuant to NDAC 43-02-03-28 (Safety Regulation) \u201cNo boiler, portable electric lighting generator, or treater shall be \nplaced nearer than 150 feet to any producing well or oil tank.\u201d  Due to drainage adjacent to the well site, a dike is required \nsurrounding the entire location.  Remote pit is NOT approved at this time.  OASIS PETRO NO AMER must contact NDIC \nField Inspector Richard Dunn at 701-770-3554 prior to location construction. \n \nDrilling pit \nNDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that \u201ca pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well drilling and completion \noperations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will prevent pollution of the land surface and \nfreshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits are prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized \nrepresentative of the director prior to lining and use.  Drill cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director \nprior to placement in a cuttings pit.\u201d \n \nForm 1 Changes & Hard Lines  \n  Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.  The proposed directional \nplan is at a legal location.  Based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum legal coordinate from the well head is: 9972\u2019E. \n \nLocation Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period) \n   Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the approved drilling permit \non the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report.   If circumstances require operations to commence before the 3rd business day following \npublication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may be waived by the Director.  Application for a waiver must be by sworn \naffidavit providing the information necessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and \nany other information that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the drilling permit, \nthe applicant should retain the permit. \n \nPermit Fee & Notification \n   Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card .The permit fee has been received.  It is requested that notification be given \nimmediately upon the spudding of the well.  This information should be relayed to the Oil & Gas Division, Bismarck, via telephone.  The \nfollowing information must be included:  Well name, legal location, permit number, drilling contractor, company representative, date and \ntime of spudding.  Office hours are 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is (701) 328-\n8020, leave a message if after hours or on the weekend.\n\nBrandi Terry \nMay 5, 2014 \nPage 2 \n \nSurvey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells \n   NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey contractor shall file a certified copy \nof all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion.  Surveys must be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a \nform approved by the director. However, the director may require the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the \nsurvey is needed to conduct the operation of the director's office in a timely manner.  Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one \nadobe document, with a certification cover page to certsurvey@nd.gov.    \nSurvey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.  \nSpecifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve (or when sliding) and 90 \nfeet in the lateral. \n \nSurface casing cement \n \nTail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12 hours, and tail cement \nutilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi before drilling the plug or initiating tests.   \n \nLogs \n \nNDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of (1) a suite of open hole logs from which formation tops and porosity zones \ncan be determined, (2) a Gamma Ray Log run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore, and (3) a log from which the \npresence and quality of cement can be determined (Standard CBL or Ultrasonic cement evaluation log) in every well in which production \nor intermediate casing has been set, this log must be run prior to completing the well.  All logs run must be submitted free of charge, as \none digital TIFF (tagged image file format) copy and one digital LAS (log ASCII) formatted copy. Digital logs may be submitted on a \nstandard CD, DVD, or attached to an email sent to digitallogs@nd.gov \n   \nThank you for your cooperation.  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nSincerely,

and Other Filter Media \n \n \n \n \nLeakproof Container Required \n \n \n \n \nOil and Gas Wells \n \nDear Operator, \n \nNorth Dakota Administrative Code Section 43-02-03-19.2 states in part that all waste material associated with \nexploration or production of oil and  gas must be properly disposed of in an authorized facility in accord with all \napplicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations. \n \nFiltration systems are commonly used during oil and gas operations in North Dakota.  The Commission is very \nconcerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry. \n \nEffective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the \nwell is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations \nare conducted.  The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an \nauthorized facility.  Such containers must be: \n\uf0b7 \nleakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container \n\uf0b7 \ncovered to prevent precipitation from entering the container \n\uf0b7 \nplacard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container \n \nIf the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but \nonly upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request. \n \nAs previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01 \nstates in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production \nwastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste \nManagement.  Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the \nsolid waste program.  Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud, \ninvert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.  \n \nThank you for your cooperation.  \n \n \n \nSincerely, \n \n \n \nBruce E.
