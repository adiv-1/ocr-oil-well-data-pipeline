Box 1032    Enid, Oklahoma 73702 \n(580) 233-8955 \nTo: \nTodd Holweger, NDIC \nFrom: Shawn Svob \nDate: \n4/5/2012 \nRe: \nContinental Resources standard CCL, CBL, 4-1/2\u201d liner running and testing procedures \n \nContinental Resources\u2019 standard practice for running the cement bond log and casing \ncaliper log is to run both logs immediately after coming out of the hole after TD, prior to running \nthe 4-1/2\u201d liner, to the deepest depth obtainable; however, if there are well control concerns that \nrequire us to run the liner sooner, only the CBL will be run and the CCL will be run after setting \nthe liner.   \nBased on the CCL results, we determine the actual API minimum burst allowance for the 7\u201d \ncasing.   If the downgraded API burst pressure is below our minimum required frac pressures, we \nwill run a 4-1/2\u201d frac string; if severe wear or holes are found in the casing, we will run a 5\u201d \ncemented, to surface, tie back string.   \nThe CBL log is run in order to determine the top of cement, as required by the NDIC. \nOur current 4-1/2\u201d liner program for a 1280 unit is 30, evenly spaced, stages with 29 swellable \npackers.  The liner shoe is set approximately 180 feet off bottom.  The shoe stage below the last \npacker has 2 joints, a double valved float, one joint, and a ported guide shoe \u2013 appx 130 ft.  The \nliner is run using a running tool on the end of 4\u201d DP.  The 7\u201d packer/hanger is set about 40 ft \nabove KOP between two casing collars but conditions occasionally occur that require setting \nhigher, either through unexpected failure or in order to isolate casing wear close to KOP.  \nRecently we have tried 40 stage liners and the trend to explore the optimum stage count will \ncontinue..  Once the liner is at depth, a ball is dropped through the DP, the ball is pressured up \nagainst the setting tool to approximately 2500 psi, and the 7\u201d packer/hanger is set. \nA push pull test is done to confirm the hanger has set.  Then, a 4500 psi pressure test is \ncompleted on the back side of the 4\u201d DP to confirm the packer has set.  The setting tool is then \nbacked off and the 4\u201d DP/running tool is laid down. \nImmediately after the rotary rig has been moved off the well location, the 7\u201d csg and liner \npacker/ hanger are tested to the frac pressure.  The testers will rig up and test the tubing head to \n5000 psi.  Next a test plug will be run and set, using wire line, in the top of the 7\u201d packer/hanger.  \nTesters will pressure up to our frac pressure, typically 8500 psi, to confirm the 7\u201d is ready for \ncompletion.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nShawn Svob \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDrilling Operations Coordinator"

The directional wellbore lies\napproximately 660\u00b0 FEL of See. 4, T153N, R101W, terminating at a BHL 769\" N. of SHL, 2094\u201d FSL\nof Sec. 4, TIS3N, RIOIW. Botlom hole TVD of the existing directional well is 13451\u00b0, The deepest\ncasing string is 8-3/8\u201d set at a depth of 3035\u201d TVD.\nThe proposed Columbus Federal 3-16H1 is a horizontal well targeting the Middle Bukken formation.\nSurface hole location for the Columbus Federal 3-16H is 2469\u201d FSL and 199\u00b0 FEL, of Sec. 16, TIS3N,\nRIOLW. The majority of the Columbus Federal 3-16H lateral will lie 760\u00b0 FEL in order to avoid the\nexisting Mildred 1 wellbore by approximately 100\u00b0. The lateral will taper back to 660\u00b0 FEL, at 10155\u00b0\nN. of SHL, after adequately clearing the segment of the Mildred 1 wellbore within this Baker-Bakken\npool.\n\u2018The Baker-Bakken pool, as defined by NDIC Order No. 21551, is the interval from 50 feet above the top\nof the Bakken Formation to above the top of the Birdbear Formation. CRI has assessed the geology of\nthe area and has determined this Bakken interval to be approximately 10461? TVD to 10,771\" TVD. On\nthe surface planar, the Mildred 1 wellbore exist in this interval for approximalely 38\u00b0, from 1874\u201d FST\nto 1912\" FSL of Sec. 4, TIS3N, RW.\nThe completion of the Columbus Federal 3-16H will protect the integrity of the Mildred 1 wellbore.\nStimulation plans will be made to include a buffer zone with swell packers of a minimum 500\u00b0 from\neither side of the Mildred 1 wellbore existing within the Baker-Baicken pool. This zone will not be\nperforated or completed,\nCRI believes adequate precautions have been taken to provent the possibility of a wellbore collision and\naccepts all responsibility should such a collision oecur.\n.

The storage tanks on site store petroleum based drilling mud,\ndiesel fuel, the invert tanks being the base for the drilling mud, salt water tanks,\nfresh water tanks, crude oil storage tanks and empty tanks for emergency\nstorage. in addition to the storage tanks, other operations that can produce\ncontaminants are the drilling operation itself and the cuttings drying operation. It\nis the purpose of this plan to define the prevention containment and\ncountermeasure plan for discharges from any of these sources on the site. All\nthe actions taken in this regard are per approved policies of this part of 40 CFR\n112. Universally and in setting up the drilling operation on the site prevention\nmeasures are taken by grading the site to contain discharges, building in\neffective valves and other related operational and control mechanisms to prevent\ndischarges. This equipment is installed and tested prior to beginning drilling\noperations. The tanks and equipment are installed within secondary containment\nberms and containment trenches and sumps are installed around the facilities\nprior to beginning drilling operations with capacity to contain with freeboard a\nrupture of the largest vessel associated with the containment. In the event of a\ndischarge the sites are equipped with vacuums that are capable of picking up the\nspilled material and loading it into containers where it can be transferred to an\napproved disposal location. In the event of a discharge larger than can be\nhandled by Cyclone and other manpower on location or that leaks offsite and\npotentially into navigable waters of the US, the operator, under his directions will\narrange for trained contract personnel to immediately contain and clean-up the\ndischarge.\n112.7(a)(2} This plan will comply with all applicable items of this part. With\nno deviations anticipated.\n412.7(a)(3} The attached sketch shows a typical layout of the drill rig sites\ndepicting the location, size and contents of the tanks. There are no\nunderground tanks nor are there any mobile or portable containers\nassociated with these drilling locations. The site is prepared in advance of\nthe drill rig coming onto the site. The sites are designed and constructed to\ncontain spills and tank ruptures on the site. The drill rig and associated tanks\nand equipment are laid out in an efficient and effective manner to streamline the\ndrilling operation. Frack tanks are located in such a manner that they have easy\naccess to the mud tanks with valves located on both ends of transfer lines. The\ndrilling mud tanks are plumbed to the drill rig with valves appropriately located to\nPage 1 of 6"

Scheduled briefings and\ntefreshers are to be conducted with all the employees prior to and during rig up\noperations, such briefings are to be held during regularly scheduled safety\nmeetings.\n\nEmployees are assigned to make routine inspections of valves, hose connections\nand other fluid connections for leaks. These inspections are made and\ndocumented on a monthly basis at a minimum. These leaks are provided drip\npans and reported to the appropriate personnel for repair. If repairs cannot be\nreadily made then regular emptying of the drip pans is required until the repairs\ncan be made.
