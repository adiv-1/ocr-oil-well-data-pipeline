Yukon 5301 41-12T [SW SW Sec. 12-T153N-R101W] is \nlocated approximately 3 miles south of Williston in McKenzie County, North Dakota. The \nYukon 5301 41-12T is a horizontal Three Forks development well in part of Oasis Petroleum\u2019s \nCamp prospect within the Williston Basin. The vertical hole was planned to be drilled to \napproximately 10,335\u2019. The curve would be built at 12 degrees per 100\u2019 to land within the Three \nForks. This well is a two section lateral which originates in the southwest quarter of section 12, \nthen drilled south across section 13, to the southwest quarter of section 24 (Figure 2). Directional \ndrilling technologies and geo-steering techniques were used to land in the upper Three Forks \nreservoir and maintain exposure to the ideal target rock."

The Gulf Oil Exploration and Production, Lindvig 1-11-3C [SE SE \nSec. 11, T153N, R101W] is located approximately \u00bd of a mile west of the Yukon 5301 41-12T. \nThis well was completed in March of 1982 reached a total depth of 13,800\u2019 true vertical depth \n(TVD). The Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC Ash Federal 5300 11-18T [Lot 1 Section 18, \nT153N, R100W] is located approximately east north east of the Yukon 5301 41-12T. This well \nwas drilled to the Three Forks landing of 10,794\u2019 MD in August and September of 2012. The \nformation thicknesses expressed by gamma signatures in these wells, and the Oasis Petroleum \nNorth America, LLC Larry 5301 44-12B [SE NE Section 12, T153N, R101W] were used to \nassist in landing the curve. This was accomplished by comparing gamma signatures from the \noffset wells to gamma data collected during drilling operations. The casing target landing was \nperiodically updated to ensure accurate landing of the curve. Data used in this evaluation are \nincluded as an appendix to this report."

    "text": "GEOLOGY  \n \nMethods  \n \nGeologic analysis for the Yukon 5301 41-12T was provided by Sunburst Consulting, Inc. \nInformation was networked through Rig-watch\u2019s electronic data recorder system. This \ninformation network provided depth, drilling rate, pump strokes and total gas units to multiple \nareas throughout the well site. Gas data was fed from Sunburst\u2019s digital gas detector, a total gas \nchromatograph, through Rig-watch for dissemination. Hydrocarbon constituents (C1 through C4) \nwere recorded in part-per-million concentrations. Gas sampling was pulled through \u00bc\u201d polyflo \ntubing after agitation in Sunburst\u2019s gas trap at the shakers. Rig crews caught lagged samples at \nthe direction of the well site geologists. Samples were collected at 30\u2019 intervals in the \nvertical/curve and 30\u2019 intervals in the lateral. Rock cuttings were analyzed in wet and dry \nconditions under a 10x45 power binocular microscope (for detailed lithologic descriptions see \nappendix). Cuttings were sent to North Dakota Geologic Survey. In addition to rock samples, \nrate of penetration and gamma ray data were also used in geologic analysis to aid geo-steering \nand dip calculations.  \n \nLithology \n \nFormation analysis began at 8,240\u2019 MD with a siltstone and anhydrite characteristic of the \nKibbey Formation [Mississippian Big Snowy Group]. This interval consisted of an earthy, red to \norange, red brown, light orange to off white, trace light brown, friable siltstone that was \nmoderately calcite cemented with an earthy texture. The Kibbey \u201cLime\u201d was logged at 8,366' \nMD 8,365' TVD (-6,246') (SS). This marker is represented by an off white anhydrite which was \nmicrocrystalline, soft, massive, and amorphous. The anhydrite is often accompanied by slower \npenetration rates as the bit transitions out of the overlying siltstone. The rate of penetration \n(ROP) then increases as the bit exits the anhydrite cap to this marker and enters the underlying \nlimestone mudstone to wackestone. This carbonate was described as a light gray light gray \nbrown, off white lime mudstone which was microcrystalline, friable, and dense with an earthy \ntexture. Samples in the lower section consisted of red to orange, red brown, light orange to off \nwhite, trace light brown, friable and blocky siltstone with calcite cement moderately cemented. \nThis facies was interbedded with soft, off white amorphous or microcrystalline anhydrite.  \n \nThe Charles Formation [Mississippian Madison Group] consisted of salt, anhydrite, limestone \nand argillaceous lime mudstone. The first Charles salt was drilled at 8,508' MD 8,507' TVD (-\n6,338') SS. The Base of the Last Salt (BLS) was logged at 9,214' MD 9,212' TVD (-7,093') SS as \nindicated by slower penetration rates and increased weight on bit. The beds of salt within the \nCharles Formation can be identified by an increase in penetration rates and lower API gamma \ncount rates. Samples of the salt intervals were described as frosted, translucent, anhedral to \nsubhedral, with no visible porosity. Slower penetration rates were observed as the bit \nencountered sections of light brown, gray brown, gray, gray brown lime mudstone which was \nfriable to firm and dense, with an earthy texture. This limestone was argillaceous in part in areas \nwhere gamma API counts were elevated, and contained a trace of disseminated pyrite. No visible \noil stain was noted. In areas where the penetration rates were slowest anhydrite was logged. \nThese samples were described as off white, light gray, soft, massive and amorphous. Within the \nCharles Formation at 9,126\u2019 MD slower penetration rates indicated the presence of anhydrite."

    "text": "After exiting intermediate casing the well-bore onsite personnel attempted to steer the well-bore \ndown to the low gamma portion of the drilling zone to attempt to establish dip. After multiple \nencounters with tight streaks which moved the well-bore\u2019s inclination above 90 degrees the \ndirectional drillers were able to position the well-bore in the lower gamma area of the drilling \nzone.  At this point the target zone was revised to an 8 foot drilling zone located sixteen feet into \nthe Three Forks Formation. The revised plan was implemented to avoid deflections from \nmultiple tight streaks located high in formation, and to take advantage of the low gamma \nprimarily dolomitic facies which proved useful for steering decisions. Steering decisions from \nthis point were made by using the higher gamma, of the claystone, the low gamma located in the \nmiddle to higher portion of the drilling zone, and the fluctuating high to medium gamma located \nat the top of the drilling zone.  \n \nAt 20,573\u2019 MD while taking a check shot to determine the well-bore inclination, spiking \ndifferential pressure shut down the pumps. It was determined that the well-bore had entered the \npronghorn formation at 20,530\u2019 MD, which was causing the hole to pack off. Working the pipe \nand pumping cleared the hole enough to take a survey at 20,573\u2019 MD with a survey depth of \n20,520\u2019, which showed an inclination of 91.5\u00ba. A previous check shot at 20,535\u2019 MD and a \nsurvey depth of 20,482\u2019 showed an inclination of 90.5\u00ba; a difference of 1\u00ba change in inclination \nover 38\u2019 while rotating. This illustrates one of the problems encountered in the later portion of \nthe lateral. Despite multiple down side slides, the well-bore showed a persistent tendency to \nbuild rapidly on rotation. Onsite personnel at this time were plotting the formation inclination at \n0.61\u00ba up, which had been recently revised from a 1.12\u00ba up dip. The data from the pronghorn \nstrike when plotted with previous data determined that the formation had unexpectedly rolled \nover to a dip of 0.01. This unexpected dip change combined with the well-bores tendency to \nbuild on rotation, and the difficulty in sliding, and obtaining effective slides all contributed to the \npronghorn strike.  \n \nSamples tended to contain a greater quantity of the tan to cream, rare off white dolomite where \ngamma values were lower, and relatively a greater quantity of the blue green gray shale where \ngamma values were higher. Samples from the claystone contained a dolomite mudstone, which \nwas gray, tan to cream, with a trace of light gray, and a trace of off white. It was very fine \ncrystalline, friable, dense, with an earthy texture. Minerals present were rare disseminated pyrite, \nalong with a trace of nodular pyrite. Also noted was possible intercrystalline porosity, and \ncommon spotty light to medium brown oil stain. Also present in samples taken from the higher \ngamma claystone facies was shale. This shale was a light gray green to light gray, pale green \nwith a trace off white. This shale was firm, subblocky, with an earthy texture, along with a trace \ndisseminated pyrite.  No visible oil stain was noted in the observed shale. Where the low gamma \nwas encountered in the bottom of the target interval, thin layers of dolomite contained possible \nfair to good intercrystalline porosity and common spotty light to medium brown oil staining.  \n \nThe TD of 21,450\u2019 MD was achieved at 1550 hours CDT on July 16, 2013.

The 7\" casing shoe is \nacross the hard line, but the perforations are not. \nAs a result of the likely case that there is not sufficient cement isolation across the hardline, Oasis Petroleum is \nrespectfully requesting permission to use the swellable packer configuration described above in order to achieve \nisolation prior to fracture stimulation. --. ~ \n; \ni s \nl tv\\. \nCompany \nrelephone Number \nOasis Petroleum North America LLC \n(281) 404-9634 \nAddress \n1001 Fannin, Suite 1500 \nCity \nI \nState \n'Zip Code \nHouston \n.. \nTX \n77002 \nSignature \n~ \nPrinted Name \nWuL \nMike Brown \nTitle \nDate \nDrilling Engineer II \nJuly 5, 2013 \nEmail Address \nmbrown@oasispetroleum.com"

The \napproval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than \nthe 200' setback from the north & south boundaries and 500' setback from the east & west boundaries within \nthe 1280 acre spacing unit consisting of Sections 1 & 12. Tool error is not required pursuant to order \n \nPERMIT STIPULATIONS: A Closed Mud System is required on multi-well pads, although the disposal \nof drill cuttings is contingent upon site specific conditions to be determined by an NDIC Field \nInspector.  A perimeter dike is required along the north & east sides of the location.  OASIS must \ncontact NDIC Field Inspector Marc Binns at 701-220-5989 prior to location construction. \n \nForm 1 Changes & Hard Lines  \n  Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.  \nThe proposed directional plan is at a legal location.  The maximum legal coordinate from the well head at casing \npoint is: 150W.   Also, based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum legal coordinate from the well \nhead is: 9952S & 150W. \n \nLocation Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period) \n   Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the \napproved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report.   If circumstances require operations to \ncommence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may \nbe waived by the Director.  Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information \nnecessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other \ninformation that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the \ndrilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit. \n \nPermit Fee & Notification \n   Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card .The permit fee has been received.  It is requested \nthat notification be given immediately upon the spudding of the well.  This information should be relayed to the \nOil & Gas Division, Bismarck, via telephone.  The following information must be included:  Well name, legal \nlocation, permit number, drilling contractor, company representative, date and time of spudding.

Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe \ndocument, with a certification cover page to certsurvey@nd.gov.    \nSurvey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.  \n \nReserve pit \n \nPlease be advised that conditions may be imposed on the use and reclamation of a drilling reserve pit on \nthis site if specific site conditions warrant. \n \nSurface casing cement \n \nTail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12 \nhours, and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi \nbefore drilling the plug or initiating tests.   \n \nLogs \n \nNDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of a Cement Bond Log from which the presence of \ncement can be determined in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set and a Gamma \nRay Log must be run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore.  All logs must be submitted as \none paper copy and one digital copy in LAS (Log ASCII) format, or a format approved by the Director.  Image \nlogs that include, but are not limited to, Mud Logs, Cement Bond Logs, and Cyberlook Logs, cannot be produced \nin their entirety as LAS (Log ASCII) files.  To create a solution and establish a standard format for industry to \nfollow when submitting image logs, the Director has given approval for the operator to submit an image log as a \nTIFF (*.tif) formatted file.  The TIFF (*.tif) format will be accepted only when the log cannot be produced in its \nentirety as a LAS (Log ASCII) file format. The digital copy may be submitted on a 3.5\u201d floppy diskette, a standard \nCD, or attached to an email sent to digitallogs@nd.gov    \nThank you for your cooperation.  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nSincerely,  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nTodd L.
