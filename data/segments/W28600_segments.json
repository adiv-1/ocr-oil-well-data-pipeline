The \nhorizontal well was spud on June 22, 2014 and represents a continuation of Oasis Petroleum\u2019s \ndevelopment of the Three Forks Formation within Baker Field. The Chalmers was planned to \ndrill an approximately 9,863\u2019 lateral along a proposed azimuth of 91.34\u00b0. The well bore will be \nenhanced for production by multistage fracture stimulation. \n \nOFFSET CONTROL INFORMATION \n \nOffset well data used for depth correlation during curve operations are found in the \u2018Structure\u2019 \nsection appended to this report. The Chalmers 5301 44-24 3BR and the Chalmers 5301 44-24 \n2TR were the primary offsets used because they are located on the same pad.\n\nFigure 2:  Offsetting control wells in relation to the Chalmers 44-22 4T2 well. \n \nGEOLOGIC EVALUATION \n \nMethods: \n \nGeologic supervision of the Chalmers 5301 44-24 4T2R was provided by Sunburst Consulting, \nInc. with two well site geologists. A digital gas detector and chromatograph were interfaced with \na Pason electronic data recorder system. The unit of measure for gas on this well was units (u), \nwhich was defined as 100 units equaling 1% methane equivalent in air. The EDR provided drill \nrate, on-off bottom and pump strokes to the gas detection computer and received total gas \ninformation from Sunburst for viewing around location. Lagged samples were caught by the rig \ncrew in 30\u2019 intervals from 8,230\u2019 MD to 10,870\u2019 MD, 10\u2019 intervals from 10,870\u2019 MD to 11,170\u2019 \nMD, and 30\u2019 intervals from 11,170\u2019 MD to 20,963\u2019 TD. Wet and dry cuttings were examined \nunder a tri-ocular microscope and complete lithologic descriptions and sampling intervals are \nprovided in the lithology document within this evaluation. The set of dry cuttings collected \nduring the duration of the well were sent to the State of North Dakota. Evidence of light \nhydrocarbons present in the drilling fluid was reported by the gas chromatography equipment \nand documented on the mud log presented with this report. \n \nZones of Interest: \n \nThe Mission Canyon Formation (Mississippian; Madison Group) was drilled at 9,288\u2019 TVD       \n(-7,320\u2019) and is comprised largely of light gray lime mudstone followed by gray to tan earthy \ntextured argillaceous lime mudstone. Shows within the Mission Canyon ranged from 30 to 190 \nunits against 9.6 ppg mud. \n \nMap By Clay Hargett \nOasis Petroleum North America\n\nFigure 3 & 4:  Wet cutting of the Lodgepole Formation (left) and False Bakken sub-interval (right) at 10X.  \n \nThe top of the Lodgepole Formation was logged at 9,846\u2019 TVD (-7,878\u2019).  In general the \nLodgepole can be described as a medium to dark gray brown argillaceous lime mudstone with a \ncrystalline texture and trace amounts of disseminated pyrite (Figure 3). The False Bakken \n(Carrington Shale), drilled at 10,574\u2019 TVD (-8,606\u2019), is comprised of very dark brown to black, \nslightly pyritic shale with an earthy texture, and was found to be soft to firm (Figure 4). Strong \nhydrocarbon shows in the lower 100\u2019 of the Lodgepole were as high as 204 total gas units; \nsuggest that some of the oil and gas from the Upper Bakken Shale may be exploiting fractures \nthought to exist in the Lower Lodgepole.   \n \nThe Bakken Formation (Devonian \u2013 Mississippian) has four formal members, an upper and \nlower black, fissile, organic-rich pyritic shale, separated by an arenaceous limestone, siltstone \nand silty sandstone middle member. These three members overlay a silty shale or siltstone of the \nPronghorn Member toward the basin depositional center. The Upper Bakken Shale was drilled at \n10,585\u2019 TVD (-8,617\u2019) with sample returns typically described as black, carbonaceous, \npetroliferous shale with trace amounts of disseminated pyrite (Figure 5). The Middle Bakken, \npenetrated at 10,600\u2019 TVD (-8,632\u2019), consists of a varying thickness and sequence of interbedded \nsiltstone, limestone and silty sandstone. Trace spotty light brown oil staining was present along \nwith gas shows as high as 330 TGU. Penetrated at 10,639\u2019 TVD (-8,671\u2019), the Lower Bakken \nShale was described as a black to dark brown carbonaceous shale with trace amounts of \ndisseminated pyrite (Figure 6). Gas shows encountered in the Lower Bakken read as high as \n548u (C1-C4). The Pronghorn was penetrated at 10,654\u2019 TVD (-8,686\u2019) and is commonly \ndescribed as a dark to medium gray siltstone with calcite cement. \n \n \n \nFigure 5 & 6: Wet cuttings of the Upper Bakken Shale (left), Lower Bakken Shale (right) at 10X.\n\nThe Three Forks Formation (Devonian; Kaskaskia Sequence.) represents a regressive sequence \ndeposited in a supratidal sabkha environment. The first bench was drilled at 10,676\u2019 TVD          \n(-8,708\u2019) and is comprised of a light to medium gray, cream to off white sucrosic dolomite with \ntrace to occasional amounts of disseminated pyrite and light green shale also with trace amounts \nof disseminated pyrite. The second bench was drilled at 10,706\u2019 TVD (-8,738\u2019) and is comprised \nof a light to medium gray, cream to off white dolomite with trace to occasional amounts of \ndisseminated pyrite and light green shale also with trace amounts of disseminated pyrite (Figure \n7). The dolomite also contains possible intercrystalline porosity. Another component of the \nThree Forks is are light gray brown to gray green claystone with dolomite cement and trace \namounts of pyrite overlain by an orange to pink and green dolomite. Shows within the Three \nForks Formation ranged from 50 to 430 units in a drilling mud of 9.5-10.5 ppg. \n \nFigure 7: Wet cuttings of the Three Forks 2nd Bench dolomite and shale at 10X.  \n \nGeo-steering: \n \nKick-off point for the curve was established from the isopach of the \u201cbase last salt\u201d marker to the \nThree Forks \u201ctarget\u201d in the offset wells. The Chalmers 5301 44-24 3BR was used as the primary \noffset through the vertical and curve sections. While drilling the curve, measured gamma ray \nsignatures were compared to those of the three offsets and aided in the landing of the curve. The \nlanding target was confirmed by the depth of the False Bakken, which was consistent with the \noffset wells. The curve was successfully landed within the Three Forks Formation at a depth of \n11,100\u2019 MD (10,709\u2019 TVD) placing the well bore approximately 3\u2019 below the first Claystone \nmember.  Directional tools were then pulled out of the hole and a string of 7\u201d casing was set \n(11,042\u2019 MD) and then cemented by Schlumberger.  \n \nSamples from the target zone varied in porosity, oil staining, color, cementation, and pyrite \ncontent. Stratigraphic location in the target zone was based on these sample observations along \nwith gas shows, drill rates and gamma ray values. Severe doglegs were to be avoided so as to \nobtain the desired vertical section and aid in a successful completion liner run at TD.  \n \nThe Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC prospect geologist defined the  an initial target zone \nas an 20\u2019 zone that began 6\u2019 below the first Claystone member and ended six feet above the \nsecond claystone member  32\u2019 below the first Claystone member. The target zone consisted of an \nupper dolomite and shale interval reading 120-150 count gamma (A marker).  The center of the \ntarget interval was comprised of a cleaner dolomite with lesser amounts of shale reading 90-120\n\ncount gamma (B marker). The base of the target zone was characterized by a clean dolomite with \ntrace amounts of shale with gamma readings of 70-90 (C marker). The A-C gamma markers \nwere used for determining depth within the target interval and plotted on the Chalmers 44-22 \n4T2R dip profile (Figure 9). \n \n \n \nFigure 8:  Offset gamma ray profile of the upper Three Forks (0-200 api. scale) *See dip profile \n(Figure 9) for marker presentation* \n \nUsing the aforementioned information gathered during drilling, offset log information and the \nstructural data provided from Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC., well site geologists were \nable to anticipate, and interpret the local apparent dip during the drilling of the Chalmers 44-22 \n4T2R well. A total depth of 20,963\u2019 MD was reached on September 5th, 2014 at 15:00 CDT. \nThe target resultant was 100% within the Three Forks 2nd Bench. The resulting structure of the \nThree Forks was a fall in TVD of 83\u2019 over 9,963\u2019 MD; resulting in an overall down dip of -0.48\u00ba \nas portrayed on the Chalmers 44-22 4T2R  dip profile (Figure 9). \n \nLower Claystone \nBottom of Target \nTop of Target \nUpper Claystone \nA \nB \nC \nCross-section By Clay Hargett \nOasis Petroleum North America\n\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n140\n160\n180\n200\n220\n240\n260\n280\n300\n320\n340\n10680\n10690\n10700\n10710\n10720\n10730\n10740\n10750\n10760\n10770\n10780\n10790\n10800\n10810\n10820\n10830\n10840\n10850\n10860\n10870\n10880\n10890\n10850\n11350\n11850\n12350\n12850\n13350\n13850\n14350\n14850\n15350\n15850\n16350\n16850\n17350\n17850\n18350\n18850\n19350\n19850\n20350\n20850\nWellbore\nClaystone 1\nThree Forks 2nd Bench\nTop of Zone\nCenter of Zone\nBase of Zone\nClaystone 2\nGamma\nDIP PROFILE\nE\nW\nDepth (TVD)\nGamma\nMeasured Depth\nOasis Petroleum North America, LLC\nChalmers 5301 44-24 4T2R\nSE SE Sec. 24, T153N, R101W\nMcKenzie County, ND\nEst dip = -0.55\u00b0\nCasing set at \n11,042' MD\nEst dip = -1.34\u00b0\nEst dip = -0.54\u00b0\nEst dip = -0.72\u00b0\nEst dip = -0.29\u00b0\nEst dip = -0.31\u00b0\nNew MWD Tool @ \n17,295' MD\nEst dip = -0.36\u00b0\nEst dip = -0.58\u00b0\nEst dip = -0.10\u00b0\nGross apparent dip = -0.48\u00b0\n \n \nFigure 9: Well profile representing estimated dip value & gamma ray for the Chalmers 44-22 4T2R lateral. \n \nHydrocarbons: \n \nGas monitoring and fluid gains were monitored to evaluate the viability of this reservoir during \nthe drilling of the Chalmers 44-22 4T2R well. In the invert mud system, hydrostatic conditions \nwere maintained near balance. This allowed for gas and fluid gains from the well to be \nmonitored. Gas shows were encountered in vertical, curve and lateral drilling of the well. \n \nBackground gas observed during the drilling of the lateral ranged from 45 to 280 units. Invert \ndrilling fluid was used throughout the drilling of the vertical and curve weighing 9.6-10.4 ppg. \nThe lateral was drilled with saline drilling fluid with a mud weight of 9.5-9.6 ppg. Gas shows \nranged up to 420 units and connection gases were observed up to 335 units. C1-C4 gas \ncomponents were observed throughout the course of the lateral. Trip gases were observed as high \nas 1928 units. Oil shows were very light throughout the lateral ranging from 0-3% in sample. \nWhen present it was a light brown spotty oil stain that yielded a slow to moderate streaming to \ndiffuse light green cut fluorescence.\n\nSUMMARY \n \nThe Nabors B25 drilling rig successfully drilled a two-section horizontal well bore within the \nThree Forks Formation at the Chalmers 44-22 4T2R. A net of 9,863\u2019 was drilled within the \nThree Forks. A mud program consisting of diesel invert (9.8\u201310.4 ppg), during the vertical and \ncurve build sections, and saline based mud (9.5-9.6 ppg), during the lateral maintained stable \nhole conditions and permitted adequate analysis of gas concentrations.  \n \nProjections of dip were successfully used to maintain the well bore in the Three Forks 2nd Bench  \nfor 100% of the lateral. Samples from the target consisted of a light to medium gray, cream to off \nwhite dolomite with trace to occasional amounts of disseminated pyrite and light green shale also \nwith trace amounts of disseminated pyrite. Intercrystalline porosity was generally seen \nthroughout the entire lateral. Hydrocarbon shows in the target zone were high throughout the \nlateral. Samples from the ideal zone contained a spotty light brown oil stain. \n \nThe Chalmers 44-22 4T2R will be fitted with a 4 \u00bd\u201d production liner and swell packers in \npreparation for a fracture stimulation that will determine the true commercial value of the well. \nThe well currently awaits fracture stimulation. \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \nHannah Thatcher \nDaniel Haynes \nSunburst Consulting, Inc. \nSeptember 5, 2014"

The \napproval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than \nthe 500' setback from the north & south boundaries and 200' setback from the east & west boundaries within the \n1280 acre spacing unit consisting of Sections 19 & 20 T153N R100W.  \n \nPERMIT STIPULATIONS: DUE TO STREAM ADJACENT TO THE WELL SITE, A DIKE IS \nREQUIRED SURROUNDING THE ENTIRE LOCATION.  In cases where a spacing unit is \naccessed from an off-site drill pad, an affidavit must be provided affirming that the surface owner of the \nmulti-well pad agrees to accept burial on their property of the cuttings generated from drilling the \nwell(s) into an offsite spacing/drilling unit.  Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with \nplacard) for filter sock disposal must be maintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, \nand must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations are \nconducted.  OASIS PETRO NO AMER must contact NDIC Field Inspector Richard Dunn at 701-770-\n3554 prior to setting conductor. \n \nDrilling pit \nNDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that \u201ca pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well \ndrilling and completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will \nprevent pollution of the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits \nare prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized representative of the director prior to lining and use.  \nDrill cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings \npit.\u201d \n \nForm 1 Changes & Hard Lines  \n  Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.  \nThe proposed directional plan is at a legal location.  The minimum legal coordinate from the well head at casing \npoint is: 445\u2019 east.   Also, based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum legal coordinates from the \nwell head are: 377\u2019 south and 10558\u2019 east.\n\nHeather McCowan \nJune 11, 2014 \nPage 2 \n \nLocation Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period) \n   Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the \napproved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report.   If circumstances require operations to \ncommence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may \nbe waived by the Director.  Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information \nnecessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other \ninformation that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the \ndrilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit. \n \nPermit Fee & Notification \n   Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card .The permit fee has been received.  It is requested \nthat notification be given immediately upon the spudding of the well.  This information should be relayed to the \nOil & Gas Division, Bismarck, via telephone.  The following information must be included:  Well name, legal \nlocation, permit number, drilling contractor, company representative, date and time of spudding.  Office hours are \n8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is (701) 328-8020, leave a \nmessage if after hours or on the weekend.  \n \nSurvey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells \n   NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey contractor \nshall file a certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion.  Surveys \nmust be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director may \nrequire the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the \noperation of the director's office in a timely manner.  Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe \ndocument, with a certification cover page to certsurvey@nd.gov.    \nSurvey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.  \nSpecifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve \n(or when sliding) and 90 feet in the lateral. \n \nSurface casing cement \n \nTail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12 \nhours, and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi \nbefore drilling the plug or initiating tests.   \n \nLogs \n \nNDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of (1) a suite of open hole logs from which formation tops and \nporosity zones can be determined, (2) a Gamma Ray Log run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore, and \n(3) a log from which the presence and quality of cement can be determined (Standard CBL or Ultrasonic cement evaluation \nlog) in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set, this log must be run prior to completing the well.  \nAll logs run must be submitted free of charge, as one digital TIFF (tagged image file format) copy and one digital LAS (log \nASCII) formatted copy.

The Commission is very \nconcerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry. \n \nEffective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the \nwell is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations \nare conducted.  The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an \nauthorized facility.  Such containers must be: \n\uf0b7 \nleakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container \n\uf0b7 \ncovered to prevent precipitation from entering the container \n\uf0b7 \nplacard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container \n \nIf the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but \nonly upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request. \n \nAs previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01 \nstates in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production \nwastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste \nManagement.  Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the \nsolid waste program.  Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud, \ninvert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.  \n \nThank you for your cooperation.  \n \n \n \nSincerely, \n \n \n \nBruce E.
