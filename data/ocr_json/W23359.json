    "text": "WELL SYNOPSIS \n \n \n \nWell Plan: \nThe Atlanta 14-6H was spud on March 5th, 2013 with a surface location of  \n495\u2019 FNL and 1485\u2019 FWL, NENW Section 6 - Township 153 North and Range 101 West in Williams \nCo., North Dakota. This well was operated by Continental Resources Incorporated with the \nobjective target of the late Devonian Three Forks Formation.   \nThe plan showed a build section with a kickoff point of 10011\u2019 MD in the Mississippian Lodgepole \nwith a 10\u00b0/100\u2019 build rate to the landing point of 10909\u2019 MD; 10584\u2019 TVD in the clean gamma \nzone within the Three Forks Formation. This zone started approximately 5\u2019 below the Three Forks. \nThe landing target was approximately 15\u2019 into the Three Forks Formation. The plan was to drill \nlateral for an estimated 8257\u2019 to the hardline in the NENE corner of section 5 - Township 153 \nNorth and Range 101 West following the estimated dip of 89.8\u00b0. The projected well path is to the \nEast with a proposed azimuth of 91.09\u00b0. \n \nThe offsets provided were the Atlanta wells already drilled on the Atlanta Eco pad. These include \nthe Atlanta 1-6H, 2-6H, 3-6H, 4-6H, 11-6H, 12-6H and 13-6H drilled by Continental Resources. \n \nGas logged in the vertical and lateral sections were monitored using Mud Logging Systems \u2013 \nMlogger & Mcontrol. (Primary Logger: ML-197 \u2013 Backup Logger ML-077) \nM-Logger CC & TC filaments calibrated with 1% and 100% test gas \u2013 Chromatograph calibrated \nwith 1% test gas (gas\u2013units). \n \n \nBuild Section: The Build assembly was picked up at 10040\u2019 MD; 10039\u2019 TVD on April 13th, 2013. The well was \nkicked off at 10040\u2019 MD on April 13th, 2013 at 13:20 hrs. This assembly was able to generate \nsufficient builds to land the build section within the target zone. The up hole markers logged were \nthe Top of the Charles Salt (830\u2019 TVD); Base of the Last Salt (9021\u2019 TVD); Mission Canyon (NP); \nand the Lodgepole (9781\u2019 TVD). The down hole markers below kick off point consisted of the False \nBakken (10486\u2019 TVD); Upper Bakken Shale (10495\u2019 TVD); Middle Bakken Member (10509\u2019 TVD); \nLower Bakken Shale (10541\u2019 TVD); and the Three Forks Dolomite (10572\u2019 TVD). These markers \ncame in consistently with the Atlanta 12-6H. With these markers coming in close to the Atlanta \n12-6H our landing was estimated at 10590\u2019 TVD. The Lower Bakken Shale had a thickness of 11\u2019 \nof actual black-brown shale, but consisted of a sticky intermediate layer (Pronghorn) below the \nshale that was 24\u2019 thick \u2013 our landing was targeted 15\u2019 below this intermediate layer. The landing \nfor 7\u201d intermediate casing was completed April 14th, 2013 at 14:45 hrs, 13\u2019 into the Three Forks \nDolomite with a landing at 10585\u2019 TVD. Casing point: 10924\u2019 MD; 10585\u2019 TVD and casing location \nof NENW Sec 6 \u2013 528\u2019 FNL & 2128\u2019 FWL (see Atlanta 14-6H build and TVD log for more \ninformation regarding samples & formation thicknesses) \n \n \n \nGas observed in the build section which showed gas averaging 46-152 units through the \nLodgepole formation with no background sample shows and oil shows. Both Upper and Lower \nBakken Shales resulted in 240-660 units. The Middle Bakken Member ranged from 240-395 units, \naveraging 450 units. The Three Forks ranged from 70-240 units, averaging 147 units. Circulating \ntrip gas through casing resulted in 75-815 units."

    "text": "WELL SYNOPSIS \n \n \n \n \nLateral Leg: \nPenetration of the lateral section started on April 17th, 2013, at 10:20 hrs with a depth of 10924\u2019 \nMD, drilling with a 6\u201d PDC bit and 1.5\u00b0 mud motor. The plan was to drill in the  \nTarget zone and follow the 9\u2019 zone of interest between two hot gamma markers, close to the \nThree Forks top (Pronghorn) in the condensed Pyrite zone. The lateral section was drilled from \n10924\u2019 MD to 19085\u2019 MD for a lateral length of 8161\u2019, with a bottom hole location: 651\u2019 FNL & \n233\u2019 FEL \u2013 NENE Sec 5, T153N-R101W \u2013 completed on April 23rd, 2013 \u2013 07:00  hrs. The lateral \nsection was drilled entirely in the Three Forks Formation with one complete trip for a BHA @ \n11977\u2019 MD.  \n \nSamples collected in the lateral section mostly consisted of light-medium gray, buff-tan \nDolomite/Limestone consisting of varying amounts of disseminated Pyrite, and also of the blue-\ngreen shale, mainly in our target zone starting 5\u2019 below the Three Forks top. The lower zone \nresulted in tan/brown clean Dolomite, above the Internal 1 Shale. These two zones showed fair to \ngood porosity, but trace amounts of oil shows and cut. Gas averaged 82 units and ranged from 82 \nunits to 1388 units of gas and displayed about 2% - 3% oil accumulating in the possum belly \u2013 \nfluorescence was generally increasing the further out we got, but didn\u2019t display large amounts of \nhydrocarbons. Connection gasses ranged from 45 units to 635 units and trip gas ranged from \n2500 units to 4200 units. (For more detailed sample descriptions \u2013 see Atlanta 14-6H Lateral Log) \n \nThe formation dip was configured using two significant hot spots in our target zone. These were \nillustrated by the upper and lower target markers. Both markers ranged from 120\u2013150 (API) and \nconsisted of erratic gamma in between these with counts ranging from 90-138 (API). Below our \nbottom target zone was a cool gamma zone roughly 4\u2019 above the cooler gamma zone we saw in \nthe beginning of the lateral. Below this cool gamma was the Internal 1 Shale with ranged from \n102-200 (API) seen around the start of the lateral. There was a total of 1262\u2019 drilled in the \nInternal 1 Shale, mostly towards the middle of the lateral. The markers in the bottom were \ndefinitely clearer cut versus the top in the target zone. The target zone displayed more Pyrite \ngiving more erratic and hotter counts whereas, below the target zone displayed less Pyrite in the \nclean tan-brown Dolomite giving us lower counts 55-89 (API). Utilizing both zones we were able \nto calculate an accurate dip angle with was different from the prognosis of the estimated \nstructure. The Formation climbed 29\u2019 from the start of the lateral, a 90.12\u00b0 formation dip, which \nwas at first projected to drop 22\u2019 through the lateral section. (For more detailed gamma \nsignatures and structure please see Atlanta 14-6H cross section)"

June 12, 2012\nReport of Geotechnical Engineering Analysis ATS No. 12-12165\nAtlanta Drift pad Near Williston, ND\nCut Sections:\nWe recommend that any structure, dritl rig, or other more permanent elements which are\nintolerant to differential Movement be placed on the cut areas of the site,\nBased on our drill Program, we know that variable depths of sand mixtures overlie fat clay glacial\ntill in the cut areas of the site. We recommend the fill pad finished elevation be established at the\nfat clay till contact or the Sands be totally removed to the glaciai till contact and then replaced with\ncompacted clays. It is desired to not have layers of sand over Clays as instability can result with\nmoisture accumulation below sands and atop clays.\nFill Sections:\nWe recommend that no structure, drill rig, or other more permanent elements which are intolerant\nto differentiat movement be placed over fill areas. Ifitis desired or necessary to occupy fill areas,\nWe recommend placement of such elements not be conducted until the fill sections have been\nallowed to consolidate for a minimum of one (1) year. We recommend the fill sections be\nMonitored for vertical and horizontal movement Upon completion in order to determine the stability\nof the sections,\nWe recommend the Swales (valleys) which will be filled have Underdrains installed Prior to placing\nfill, We recommend pairs (set of 2 pipes) of 8\u201d flexible PVC drain tile materials be installed along\nthe toes of the existing swales prior to placing fill. The underdrain pipes should be sloped to\ndaylight and must be kept unobstructed,\nFill placed on the existing toes of slopes must be keyed in a minimum depth of five (5) feet prior to\nplacing fill. Fit must also be horizontally benched into existing slopes as fill is placed, We\nrecommend benches be a minimum of 8 feet wide and be installed every two (2) feet vertically,\nDrainage Considerations:\nWe recommend an intercepting drainage trench be excavated atop the cut to divert surface runoff\naway from the site. We also recommend the final drilt pad be sloped to drain at a minimum rate\nof 5%\nWe recommend the drill pad finished surface consist of compacted clays (either exposed native\nsoils or placed clay soils) to minimize subsurface infiltration, Service gravel with separation\n. fabric should be used in traffic areas to allow for access over clay surfaces.\nEarthwork Considerations:\nAll fill soils must be Moisture conditioned to +#-3% of optimum moisture content and be compacted\nto a minimum of 95% of ASTM D 698 Standard proctor value,\nLoose iifts of fill must nat exceed 8\" and may be increased to 12\u201d if Proper compaction equipment\nis used and density is verified. Cut/fill earthwork Operations in freezing weather must be\nmonitored for frost intrusion and frost lensing. Cut/fit! arthwork in winter months is not\nrecommended for this site due to the depths of fill Dlanned.\n2"

This analysis\nwas authorized by Jade Hedge of Brosz Engineering on behalf of Continental Resources.\nOur services included laboratory testing of provided samples, performing engineering analysis, providing\nrecommendations for use in drill pad design and construction. Results of the laboratory tests are\npresented in the report.\nOur professional services were performed using the degree of care and skill ordinarily exercised, under\nsimilar circumstances, by geotechnical engineers practicing in this or similar localities. No other\nwarranty, express or implied, is made. This report is not a bidding document. Any contractor reviewing\nthis report must draw his own conclusions regarding site conditions and specific construction techniques\nto be used on this project.\nPROJECT INFORMATION\nProject information supplied by Brosz Engineering indicates Continental Resources intends to\nconstruct a drill pad near Williston, North Dakota, ft is our understanding the site will be leveled by\nmassive cut/fill construction. Based on our review of the provided site plans, some fill sections\nwill be upwards of 50 feet in depth. Based on the request for proposal from Brosz Engineering,\nwe are to provide a geotechnical evaiuation of the site, provide recommendations for benching\nand side slopes, and provide slope construction guidelines.\nWe previously submitted (March, 2012) a proposal for the work at this site which included a slope\nstability analysis. We understand the Owner elected not to conduct the slope stability analysis.\nSUBSURFACE EXPLORATION & TESTING PROGRAMS\nWe conducted ten (10) explorations to depths of 21 to 61 feet below existing site grades at the Atlanta\nDrill pad site. The explorations were at the approximate location shown on the attached site plan,\nThe Unified Soil Classification System was used to classify the soils encountered. Laboratory analyses\nwere performed on representative soi! samples to aid in material classification and to estimate pertinent\nengineering properties of the on-site soils. Testing was performed in accordance with applicable ASTM\nspecifications\nThe scope of our services did not include any environmental assessment or investigation for the\nPresence or absence of hazardous or toxic materials in the soil, surface water, groundwater or air, on\nor below this site. All conditions noted or observed are strictly for the information of our client. If\nenvironmental information is required, we recommend an environmental assessment be conducted\nwhich addresses environmental concerns.\n4"

    "text": "CONTINENTAL RESOURCES, INC, June 12, 2012\nReport of Geatechnical Engineering Analysis ATS No, 12-12165\nAtlanta Drill Pad Near Williston, ND\nSITE CONDITIONS\nSurface:\nThe Atlanta Drill Pad site is located approximately 5 miles southwest of Williston, North Dakota,\nThe site lies on the breaks of the Missouri River. The surface at the pad site consists of ridge and\nswale topography with well defined drainage swales present. The surface is primarily grass and\nweed covered with overall drainage trending to the south.\nSubsurface:\nDetailed soil profiles are presented in the boring logs in the Appendix. Based on our\nanalysis, we have determined the sail profile at the proposed Atlanta Drill Pad site consists of\nvariable depths of sand and clay glacial deposits overlying fat clay glacial till and Pierre\nShale. The sand and clay glacial deposits have variable amounts of clay, sand, gravel and\ntraces of coal. The sands are of low plasticity and the fat clay glacial till is highly plastic and\nexpansive.\nGroundwater Conditions:\nGroundwater was encountered at our Boring 4 (57' below existing site grades) location, and at\napproximately 15 to 18 feet below existing site grades at our boring 8, 9, and 10 locations (lower area\nof site). Fluctuations in the groundwater table may occur for various reasons, i.e., variations in\nprecipitation, evaporation, surface runoff, groundwater withdrawal and recharge. A more accurate\nevaluation of the water table would require installing and monitoring piezometers over an extended\ntime period.\nLaboratory Analyses:\nIn-situ moisture contents and dry densities of representative samples from the borings are presented\non the boring logs in the Appendix.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS\nGENERAL\nOur recommendations are based on the assumption that the soil conditions are similar to\nthose disclosed by the provided samples. If variations are noted during construction or if\nchanges are made in the site pian, structural foading, or foundation type, we should be\nnotified so we can supplement our recommendations, as applicable. This report does not\nencompass the effects, if any, of underlying geologic hazards or regional groundwater\nwithdrawal and expresses no opinion regarding their effects on surface movement.\nGlobal Slope Stability:\nThe Owner elected not to conduct a slope stability analysis at this site. Thus, our\nrecommendations are given with no acceptance or assumption of the global stability of the\nslopes at this site. Global stability issues may be present and may create land shifting or\nsliding in the future.\n5"

We understand the Atlanta Drill pad wit! be\ncreated with massive cut and fill earthwork techniques. Cut depths on the order of 20 to 25\nfest and fill depths up to 50 feet are planned for the construction of the drill pad.\nWe recommend an intercepting drainage trench be excavated atop the cut to divert surface\nrunoff away from the site. We also recommend the final drill pad be sloped to drain at a\nminimum rate of 5%.\nWe recommend the drill pad finished surface consist of compacted clays (either exposed\nnative soils or piaced clay soils) to minimize subsurface infiltration. Service gravel with\nseparation fabric should be used in traffic areas to allow for access over clay surfaces.\nWe are providing drift pad canstruction earthwork recommendations given the soil profile and\nknowing the earthwork required to create the drill pad.\nORILL PAD CUT SECTIONS:\nWe recommend that any structure, drill tig, or other more permanent elements which are\nintolerant fo differential movement be placed on the cut areas of the site.\nBased on our drill program, we Know that variable depths of sand mixtures overlie fat clay\nglacial till in the cut areas of the site. We recommend the fill pad finished elevation be\nestablished at the fat clay till contact or the sands be totally removed to the glacial till contact\nand then replaced with compacted clays. It is desired to not have layers of sand over clays\nas instability can result with moisture accumulation below sands and atop clays\n\nFor grading cut slope design purposes and due to the presence of sandy soils, we\n\nrecommend cut slopes be designed to slope at a rate of no steeper than 3:1 (horizontal to\n\nvertical). Said slopes will allow for maintenance and repair as necessary and will minimize\nerosion after vegetation is established. We offer the following grading guidelines for\nconstruction of surfacing or elements {excluding permanent structures) over cut sections:\n\n1) We recommend a minimum of 8 inches of the on-site surficial soils and topsoil be\nremoved, as applicable.\n\n2) We recommend the soils exposed in the cut area be scarified a minimum of 8 inches,\nand be moisture conditioned to +/-3% of optimum moisture content.\n\n3) We recommend the soils be compacted to a minimum of 95% of ASTM 698 standard\nproctor value. Compaction equipment must be sufficient to gain the desired results\nand will depend on the soils placed. The geotechnical engineer should observe,\nclassify, and test the soits during the fill placement to assure proper techniques are\nemployed.\n\n6"

We recommend stabilization/separation fabric such as\nMirafi HP370 be placed between the soil subgrade and surfacing material.\nOversized rock may be required high traffic or soft soil areas,\nDRILL PAD FILL SECTIONS:\nWe recommend that no structure, drill rig, or other more permanent elements which are\nintolerant to differential movement be Placed over fil! areas.\nif it is desired or necessary to occupy fill areas, we recommend placement of such elements\nNot be conducted until the fill sections have been allowed to consolidate for a minimum of one\n(t) year. We recommend the fill sections be monitored for verticat and horizontal movement\nupon completion in order to determine the stability of the sections.\nWe recommend the final slopes be no steeper than 3:1 (horizontal to vertical).\nUnderdrains:\nWe recommend the swales (valleys) which will be filled have underdrains installed prior to\nplacing fil. We recommend pairs (set of 2 pipes) be installed along the toes of the existing\nswales prior to ptacing fill We recommend the underdrains consist of 6\" diameter fabric\nwrapped flexible perforated drain pipe. We recommend the drain pipe be bedded with a\nminimum of 12 inches of 1\u201d clean rock bedding for the entire pipe tength at the specified\nlocations. The underdrain pipes should be sloped to daylight and must be kept unobstructed.\nKeyways:\n\nAt the foes of the existing slopes, we recommend the native soils have a keyway cut to aid in\n\nsupporting slope fill retention. We recommend the slope keyway consist of a five (5) foot\n\nminimum vertical cut in the native approved soils along the east side toe. Keyway areas\nover daylight pipe areas may be modified depending on depth. We recommend the Keyway\nbe a minimum of 10 feet in width. Additional underdrains may be required for the system if\nwater is encountered within keyways.\n\nFill Construction:\n\nWe understand the fill for the pad will come from on-site as the grading is conducted. With\n\nthe aforementioned grading plan in mind and our analysis of the soils present, we offer the\n\nfollowing grading recommendations:\n\n1) We recommend the fill areas be stripped to receive new fill. Stripping should clear all\nvegetation, topsoil and debris. The depth of such materials and horizontal extent of\nthe fil/cut slopes will vary along the proposed toe slopes.\n\n2) We recommend a minimum of 8 inches of the soils at the base of fill sections be\nremoved (includes topsoil),\n\n7"

Compaction equipment\nmust be sufficient to gain the desired results and will depend on the soils placed.\nThe geotechnical engineer should observe, classify, and test the soits during the fill\nplacement fo assure proper techniques are employed.\n\n6) Loose lifts of fill must not exceed 8\u201d and may be increased to 12\u201d if proper compaction\nequipment is used and density is verified. Cut/fill earthwork operations in freezing\nweather must be monitored for frost intrusion and frost lensing. Cut/fill earthwork in\nwinter months is not recommended for this site due to the depths of fill planned.\n\n7) We recommend that all finished fill slopes for the roadways be covered with topsoil\nand/or be hydro-seeded as soon as possible after the slopes have been finished to\navoid excessive moisture intrusion and erosion. Seeding and erosion control\nmeasures should then follow as dictated by progress.\n\n8) Erosion control measures must be implemented during and after construction to avoid .\nloss of soi! structure and sedimentation due to surface water infiltration and erosion.\nErosion control techniques and materials should be upgraded or repaired as\nnecessary during the course of construction. We recommend final slopes be no\nsteeper than 3:1 (horizontal to vertical) to reduce erosion and facilitate mowing, etc.\nSteoper slopes can be used, however, maintenance during and after construction\nmust be provided.\n\n9) We estimate a shrinkage of soil from cut to fill of 25%.\n\nBuried Debris, Large Cabbles, Boulders & Lignite Coal Lenses:\n\nBuried debris may be present at any location at this site. Traces of lignite coal was\n\nencountered during our dritfing and sampling program at this site.

Sump pumps should be present during construction to facilitate water removal\nafter inclement weather.\nSurface drainage is critical to assure fong tank pad life. Grades should be such that\ndrainage is away from all structures. Utility line excavations should be properly backfilled to\navoid possible sources for subsurface saturation, The finished exterior grades of the pad\nmust be sloped a minimum of 5% to promote positive drainage. Respective structure or weit\npads should be elevated relative to the surrounding finished grades to aid in promoting\npositive drainage.\nWe recommend the surface across the pad consist of native or placed compacted clay. We\nrecommend any clay cap material be moisture conditioned to +/-3% of optimum moisture\ncontent and be compacted to a minimum of 95% of ASTM D 698 standard proctor value.\nOSHA SLOPE STABILITY\nGENERAL\nThe owner and contractor should make themselves aware of and become familiar with\napplicable local, state, and federal safety regulations, including the current OSHA Excavation\nand Trench Safety Standards. Construction site safety generally is the sole responsibility of\nthe Contractor, who shali also be solely responsible for the means, methods, and sequencing\nof construction operations. We are providing this information solely as a service to our\nclient. Under no circumstances should the information Provided below be interpreted to\nmean that American Technical Services, Inc., is assuming responsibility for construction site\nsafety or the Contractor's activities; such responsibility is not being implied and should not be\ninferred.\nEXCAVATIONS AND SLOPES ,\nThe Contractor shoutd be aware that slope height, slope inclination, or excavation depths\n{including utility trench excavations) should in no case exceed those specified in local, state,\nor federal safety regulations, \u20ac.g,, OSHA Health and Safety Standards for Excavations, 29\nCFR Part 1926, or successor regulations, such regulations are strictly enforced and, if they\nare not followed, the Owner, Contractor, and/or earthwork and utility subcontractors could be\nliable for substantial penalties.\nFor this site, the overburden soil encountered in our exploratory investigation is primarily a\nsand. This is considered to be a type B soil when applying the OSHA regulations. OSHA\nrecommends a maximum slope inclination of 1:1 - (horizontal/vertical) for type B soils. Asa\nsafety measure, it is recommended that all vehicles and soil piles be kept a minimum lateral\ndistance from the crest of the slope equat to no less than the slope height. Also, the\nexposed slope face should be protected against the elements.\n9"

We observed\nthat the bottem of the overexcavation was taken to 5 feet below finished grades in the\nspillage liner site. The bottom of the overexcavation was recompacied and smoothed\nprior to synthetic liner installation.\nThe synthetic finer material was delivered in rolls and placed over the prepared subgrade\nsoils. We observed that the liner laps were welded as the liner materials were pulled into\nplace.\nLiner Area Bacicfiil:\nOn August 14, 2012, we observed on-site soil placement over the synthetic liner, A\ncushion layer was compacted in place then material was placed via scrapers. Water\nwas added and dozers mixed the soils prior to compaction in lifls. All compaction tests\ntaken indicate the backfili material was placed in an engineered manner."

Surveys must be \nsubmitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director may require the directional \nsurvey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the operation of the director's office in a \ntimely manner.  Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe document, with a certification cover page to \ncertsurvey@nd.gov.  Survey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.  \nSpecifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve (or when \nsliding) and 90 feet in the lateral. \n \nConfidential status \n \nYour request for confidential status of all information furnished to the Director, or his representatives, is hereby \ngranted.  Such information, except production runs, shall remain confidential for six months commencing on the date the \nwell is spud. \n \nConfidential status notwithstanding, the Director and his representatives shall have access to all well records wherever \nlocated.

CRI would like to propose the\nfollowing safeguards and precautions to be taken to prevent any contamination to freshwater sources\nduring the drilling and completion of the weil.\n\n1) During construction of the location, the entire location will be constructed per NDIC permit\nstipulations, and to ensure any spills or runoff which occur on location do not penetrate the fresh\nground water and are contained on surface of the location.\n\n2) Drainage will be re-routed to avoid the location and fiber rolls will be employed around the site\nto reduce sediment contamination to freshwater runoff due to weather events.\n\n3) \u2018the earthen berm constructed to keep any freshwater runoff off the location will also eliminate\nany spills from leaving the location\n\n4) No reserve pit or dry cuttings pit will be utilized on location.\n\n5) The conductor will be drilled to a depth of 80\u2019 and 20\u201d pipe will be run to depth and cemented ta\nsurface.\n\n6) During drilling operations, a freshwater protection string of 13-3/8\u201d 484 H40 casing will be set to\na depth of 500\u00b0 and cemented to surface to protect the shallow freshwater zones. Standard 9-\n5/8\" 36# J-55 surface casing will be set 100\u00b0 into the Pierre Shale to a depth of 1970\u00b0 and\ncemented to surface.\n\n7) A frac string will be used to protect the intermediate casing during hydraulic fracturing of the\nwell.\n\n8) CRI is submitting a comprehensive; site specific Spill Contingency Plan to prepare for any event\nwhich may occur during drilling and completion operations.\n\n9) CRI believes a Flood Prevention plan is not necessary for this site due to the Army Corps of\nEngineers documentation that the high water level for Lake Sakakawea will not affect any\nelevation 1855\u2019 above sea level or higher. The finished rig grade elevation for Atlanta location\nis 1959.6\" above sea level.\n\n10) The Auanta wells will be drilled continuously. They will be batch drilled.

Box 1032    Enid, Oklahoma 73702 \n(580) 233-8955 \nTo: \nTodd Holweger, NDIC \nFrom: Shawn Svob \nDate: \n4/5/2012 \nRe: \nContinental Resources standard CCL, CBL, 4-1/2\u201d liner running and testing procedures \n \nContinental Resources\u2019 standard practice for running the cement bond log and casing \ncaliper log is to run both logs immediately after coming out of the hole after TD, prior to running \nthe 4-1/2\u201d liner, to the deepest depth obtainable; however, if there are well control concerns that \nrequire us to run the liner sooner, only the CBL will be run and the CCL will be run after setting \nthe liner.   \nBased on the CCL results, we determine the actual API minimum burst allowance for the 7\u201d \ncasing.   If the downgraded API burst pressure is below our minimum required frac pressures, we \nwill run a 4-1/2\u201d frac string; if severe wear or holes are found in the casing, we will run a 5\u201d \ncemented, to surface, tie back string.   \nThe CBL log is run in order to determine the top of cement, as required by the NDIC. \nOur current 4-1/2\u201d liner program for a 1280 unit is 30, evenly spaced, stages with 29 swellable \npackers.  The liner shoe is set approximately 180 feet off bottom.  The shoe stage below the last \npacker has 2 joints, a double valved float, one joint, and a ported guide shoe \u2013 appx 130 ft.  The \nliner is run using a running tool on the end of 4\u201d DP.  The 7\u201d packer/hanger is set about 40 ft \nabove KOP between two casing collars but conditions occasionally occur that require setting \nhigher, either through unexpected failure or in order to isolate casing wear close to KOP.  \nRecently we have tried 40 stage liners and the trend to explore the optimum stage count will \ncontinue..  Once the liner is at depth, a ball is dropped through the DP, the ball is pressured up \nagainst the setting tool to approximately 2500 psi, and the 7\u201d packer/hanger is set. \nA push pull test is done to confirm the hanger has set.  Then, a 4500 psi pressure test is \ncompleted on the back side of the 4\u201d DP to confirm the packer has set.  The setting tool is then \nbacked off and the 4\u201d DP/running tool is laid down. \nImmediately after the rotary rig has been moved off the well location, the 7\u201d csg and liner \npacker/ hanger are tested to the frac pressure.  The testers will rig up and test the tubing head to \n5000 psi.  Next a test plug will be run and set, using wire line, in the top of the 7\u201d packer/hanger.  \nTesters will pressure up to our frac pressure, typically 8500 psi, to confirm the 7\u201d is ready for \ncompletion.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nShawn Svob \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDrilling Operations Coordinator"

This condition may be reached almost\nwithout warning as the originally detected odor of Hydrogen Sulfide may have disappeared due to\nolfactory paralysis. Death then occurs from asphyxiation uniess the exposed person is removed\nimmediately to fresh air and breathing stimulated by artificial respiration.

    "text": "TREATMENT FOR HYDROGEN SULFIDE POISONING\n\nINHALATION\nAs Hydrogen Sulfide in the blood oxidizes rapidly, symptoms of acute poisoning pass off\nwhen inhalation of the gas ceases. It is important, therefore, to get the victim of poisoning to\nfresh air as quickly as possible. He should be kept at rest and chilling should be prevented.\nIf respiration is slow, labored, or impaired, artificial respiration may be necessary. Most\npersons overcome by Hydrogen Sulfide may be revived if artificial respiration is applied\nbefore the heart action ceases. Victims of poisoning should be under the care of a\nphysician as soon as possible. Irritation due to sub-acute poisoning may lead to serious\ncomplications such as pneumonia. Under those conditions, treatment by the physician\nnecessarily would be symptomatic. The patient should be kept in fresh air, and hygienic\nconditions should be watched carefully.\n\nCONTACT WITH EYES\nEye contact with liquid and/or gas containing Hydrogen Suifide will cause painful irritation\n(conjunctivitis). Keep patient in a darkened room, apply ice compresses to eyes, put ice on\nforehead, and send for a physician. Eye irritation caused by exposure to Hydrogen Sulfide\nrequires treatment by a physician, preferably an eye specialist. The progress to recovery in\nthese cases is usually good.\n\nCONTACT WITH SKIN\nSkin absorption is very low. Skin discoloration is possible after contact with liquids\ncontaining Hydrogen Sulfide. !f such skin contact is suspected, the area should be\nthoroughly washed."

    "text": "EFFECTS OF HYDROGEN SULFIDE ON METAL\nHydrogen Sulfide dissolves in water to form a weak acid that can cause some pitting, particularly in\nthe presence of oxygen and/or carbon dioxide. However, the most significant action of H2S is its\ncontribution to a form of hydrogen embritilement known as sulfide stress cracking. Sulfide stress\ncracking is a result of metals being subjected to high stress levels in a corrosive environment where\nH2S is present. The metal will often fail catastrophically in a brittle manner. Sulfide stress cracking\nof steel is dependent upon and determined by:\na. Strength (hardness) of the stee! - the higher the strength, the greater the susceptibility to\nsulfide stress cracking. Steels having yield strengths up to 95,UOO psi and hardness up to\nRe22 are generally resistant to sulfide stress cracking. These limitations can be extended\nslightly higher for properly quenched and tempered materials.\nb. Total member stress (toad) - the higher the stress level (load) the greater the susceptibility\nto sulfide stress cracking.\nc. Corrosive environment - corrosive reactions, acids, bacterial action, thermal degradation, or\nlow PH fluid environment.\nUse as protection against sulfide stresses cracking, all casing, BOP and safety equipment should\nbe of H2S resistant material."

ATLANTA 1-6H \n6-153N-101W, WILLIAMS COUNTY, NORTH DAKOTA \n \n \n \n \nA\n1.  INTRODUCTION \n \nThe purpose of this Contingency Plan is to outline the procedures that will be implemented by Cyclone \nDrilling, Inc.\u2019s Rig No. 20 personnel should a spill or flood occur during drilling activities conducted at the \nContinental Resources, Inc. Atlanta 1-6H lease located in Section 6, 153N, 101W in Williams County, \nNorth Dakota.  Such procedures are designed to minimize the effects of spills and potential flooding on \nCyclone field personnel, Continental facilities, the surrounding community, and the environment in \ngeneral.     \n \n2.  GENERAL INFORMATION \n \n2.1 \nEquipment Description.  Cyclone Drilling, Inc. operates drilling rigs that are moved from site to \nsite therefore, the exact equipment layout will vary slightly.  The Atlanta 1-6H location \nencompasses 3.1-acres and the standard equipment for most drilling jobs is as follows: \n \nr \nMobile Rig (w/integrated fuel/oil storage tanks) \nr \nStorage Facilities \nr \nMud Pumps (diesel-powered pumps w/integrated fuel storage tanks) \nr \nGenerators (w/integrated fuel storage tanks) \nr \nWater Tanks \nr \nPipe Racks \n \n2.2 \nProximity of Rigs to Navigable Waters.  According to 40 CFR 112.7(e)(6)(i), mobile drilling \nequipment should be positioned or located so as to prevent spilled oil from reaching navigable \nwaters.  Depending on the location, catch basins or diversion structures may be necessary to \nintercept and contain fuel, crude oil, or oily drilling fluid spills.   \n \n \nThe nearest potential receiving water for an oil spill is unnamed intermittent tributary of the \nMissouri River located approximately 500-ft. south of the Atlanta 1-6 lease.  A One-Mile Radius \nMap indicating the location of Continental\u2019s Atlanta 1-6H lease is included herein as Figure 1.  \n \n \nCyclone personnel will locate Rig No. 20 and its associated equipment to best prevent a \npotential release to waterways and provide drainage and containment, as discussed in Section \n3.4 of this Plan.  A Drilling Rig Layout Map is included herein as Figure 2. \n \n2.3 \nPotential Spills and Releases.  The spill prevention system includes visual inspections and \ncontainment structures to help reduce the potential for releases to the off-site soil or surface \nwaters.  Generally, minor spills or leaks within the work site will be contained by drip pans \nlocated on skid-mounted equipment and cleaned-up using an absorbent (i.e., granular or pads).  \nA list of activities that represent the greatest potential for a release of oil to the environment is \nas follows: \n \nr \nLoading/unloading fuel, oil, and used oil to/from storage tanks and containers. \nr \nTemporary storage of oil containers outside of secondary containment."

OIL/FUEL STORAGE \n \n3.1 \nOil, Fuel, and Used Oil Storage Tanks.  The materials stored on-site are mainly used to operate \nthe drilling rig's generators and pumps and generally included the following: \n \nr \nDiesel Fuel \nr \nEngine Oil \nr \nHydraulic Oil \nr \nGear Oil \nr \nUsed Oil \n \n3.2 \nContainer Storage.  Multi-compartment storage containers are used to store hydraulic, motor \nand gear oil in approximate 100- to 150-gal. capacities.  These container is generally located \nwithin the operating area near the accumulator valve skid.  In lieu of such a multi-compartment \nstorage container, fresh oil may be stored in 55-gal. drums. \n \nUsed oil is stored in 55-gal. drums prior to contractor removal.  Because of limited available \nspace within the rig's operating area, these drums are usually stored outside the operating area.  \nIn this event, these drums will be placed in a spill containment pan or within an earthen berm.  \n \n \nContainers stored within the trenched operating area would be contained by drainage to the \nwell fluids pit.  Containers used at sites that do not use pits are provided with earthen dike \ncontainment or other containment (i.e., metal containment pan.)  The containment volume for \ncontainers located outside of the trenched operating area will be approximately 10% of the total \nvolume of all containers within the containment area.   \n \n3.3 \nTransfer Facilities.  Fuel is transferred from bulk tanks into smaller day tanks located on the \ndrilling rig, pump skids, and generator skids.  Most bulk fuel tanks are equipped with a fuel \npump attached to the skid.  The fuel level in the day tanks is usually monitored until the tank is \nfull. \n \nPersonnel transfer fresh oil from bulk storage tanks or drums into smaller tanks located on the \ndrilling rig by filling 5-gal. buckets and manually filling the smaller tanks.  Personnel transfer \nused equipment oil into 55-gal. drums using 5-gal. buckets. \n \nCyclone personnel are present at all times during oil and diesel transfer operations to ensure \nquick response in the event of a release.  In addition, all pumps are securely grounded for static \nelectricity for safety and personnel protection purposes. \n \n3.4 \nDrainage and Containment Facilities.  The drains on containment systems will be closed and \nsealed except during water drainage.  Prior to draining water the following steps will be taken:"

ATLANTA 1-6H \n6-153N-101W, WILLIAMS COUNTY, NORTH DAKOTA \n \n \n \n \nC\nr \nVisually inspect the diked areas around tanks to ensure that the water does not exhibit \nan oily sheen and will not result in a harmful discharge. \n \nr \nOpening, closing, and locking the bypass valve under responsible supervision following \ndrainage activities. \n \nr \nMaintain adequate drainage operation records.   \n \n3.5 \nBulk Storage Tanks.  The bulk storage tanks are located within a trenched area where releases \ndrain into the well fluids pit.  The well fluids pit will be sized to provide containment volume to \naccommodate the largest tank within the containment area as well as sufficient volume for \nstormwater accumulation and the volume required for well fluid storage.  Bulk storage tanks at \nsites that do not use pits are contained by an earthen containment dike constructed around the \ntank.   \n \nStormwater that collects within the trenched area flows into the well fluids pit.  Stormwater that \ncollects within the earthen dike containment structures is inspected and if no free oil or oil \nsheen is observed, Continental field personnel or their on-site representatives may pump the \nwater outside of the containment structure.  In the event oil is observed in the stormwater \nwithin the earthen dike containment structures, it is pumped into a temporary container or \nstorage tank for off-site disposal. \n \n3.6 \nTruck Loading/Unloading Areas.  Cyclone personnel will use spill containment booms to contain \na release from a truck during loading/unloading operations or hand shovels and containment \nbooms to direct the release to a containment trench or pit.  Collected oil from such a release will \nbe pumped into a temporary container or storage tank for off-site disposal. \n \n4.  FLOOD CONTINGENCY \n \nFloods can develop slowly during an extended period of rain, or in a warming trend following a heavy \nsnow.  Others, such as flash floods, can occur quickly, even without any visible signs of rain.  It's \nimportant to be prepared for flooding when working in a low-lying area, near water or downstream \nfrom a dam.  The Atlanta 1-6H lease is located approximately 500-ft. north of an unnamed intermittent \ntributary of the Missouri River at an approximate elevation of 1,953-ft. above Mean Sea Level (MSL).  A \nWell Location Map reflecting the topography of the subject site is presented herein as Figure 3.   \n \n4.1 \nFlood Watch.  A Flood Watch indicates flooding is possible.  Tune in to NOAA Weather Radio, \ncommercial radio, or television for information regarding potential timing of flooding.  Begin \npreparing to move portable equipment and storage tanks to higher ground.  Anchor equipment \nand storage tanks that cannot be readily moved.   \n4.2 \nFlash Flood Watch.  A Flash Flood Watch indicates flooding may occur without warning.  Be \nprepared to move personnel, equipment, and portable storage tanks to higher ground; listen to \nNOAA Weather Radio, commercial radio, or television for information."

Cyclone Rig No. 20 located at the Atlanta 1-6H will be properly \nequipped so that Cyclone personnel can immediately respond to an emergency during working \nhours utilizing emergency equipment.  Typical emergency equipment includes but is not limited \nto fire extinguishers, eyewash stations, first-aid stations, and spill response equipment. \nEmployees will be trained and familiarized with the use and location of all emergency \nequipment prior to beginning operations at a work site \n \n5.2 \nInternal Communication.  For larger jobs, Cyclone personnel use two-way radios to \ncommunicate between the rig personnel and supervisor.  For smaller jobs, verbal \ncommunication is sufficient.  During emergency situations, verbal communication and two-way \nradios (if available) will be used to provide immediate instructions to emergency response \npersonnel.  These systems are maintained, as necessary, to ensure proper operation during an \nemergency. \n \n5.3 \nExternal Communication.  Telephones (available on some larger jobs) and cell phones are used \nto notify Continental\u2019s office in the event of an emergency.  The office would telephone for \nassistance from local emergency response personnel, if necessary.  The phones are routinely \nused to ensure proper operation. \n \n5.4 \nInspections.  Inspections of oil storage units, containment, and emergency equipment are \nconducted routinely to detect malfunctions and deterioration, operator errors, and/or"
