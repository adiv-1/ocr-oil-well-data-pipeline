    "text": "Synopsis \n \nOasis Petroleum Kline Federal 5300 41-18 10B [SW SW Sec. 18 T153N R100W] is located ~6 \nmiles Northwest of the town of Williston, North Dakota. Kline Federal 5300 41-18 10B is \nsituated within the Baker Field. A single lateral leg trending 90\u00b0 was proposed to be drilled from \nthe SW SW corner of Section 18 to the SE SE corner of Section 17 targeting the porous \nsandstone and silty sandstone of the Middle Bakken. \n \nControl Wells \n \nTwo completed wells were used as the control offsets to the Kline Federal 5300 41-18 10B.   \n \nThe primary offset considered was the Kline Federal 5300 41-18 11T2 [SW SW Sec. 18 T153N, \nR100W] which is a horizontal well drilled by Oasis Petroleum. Kline Federal 5300 41-18 11T2 \nis located approximately 33 feet south of Kline Federal 5300 41-18 10B. \n \nThe other offset considered was the Kline Federal 5300 41-18 12TX [SW SW Sec. 18 T153N, \nR100W] which is a horizontal well drilled by Oasis Petroleum. Kline Federal 5300 41-18 12TX \nis located approximately 66 feet south of Kline Federal 5300 41-18 10B. \n \nDuring the curve, the gamma ray that was produced was constantly compared to the Kline \nFederal 5300 41-18 11T2 and the Kline Federal 5300 41-18 12TX wells. Gamma ray was used \nto help determine a proper landing depth. \n \nTo assist in the choosing of the landing target, an isopach table (Table 1) was constructed to \nmeasure the distance of formation tops to the target depth determined from the Kline Federal \n5300 41-18 11T2 and Kline Federal 5300 41-18 12TX offset wells. Comparison of gamma ray \nmarkers showed the most consistent isopach for up-hole formations to be the False Bakken."

    "text": "Geologic Assessment \n \nMethods \n \nGeologic supervision of Kline Federal 5300 41-18 10B was provided by experienced RPM well \nsite geologists. Gas and chromatograph levels were measured using NOV WellSight Gas \nDetection real time gas detector and chromatograph system.  The WellSight gas detection system \nuses non-dispersive infrared and chemical sensor gas detection to evaluate gases liberated from \nthe formation by the drill bit and carried to the surface by the drilling fluid. \n \n \nThe gas detector was interfaced with a RigWatch electronic data recorder system. RigWatch \nprovided drill rate, on-off bottom and pump strokes to the gas detector and received total gas \ninformation from the gas detector for viewing on location and remotely. \n \nUnder the direction of RPM well site geologists, rig crews were instructed to catch lagged drill \ncutting samples at 30\u2019 intervals in the vertical hole and curve build from 8,350\u2019 to 11,175\u2019 MD \nand 50\u2019 samples from 11,175\u2019 to TD (20,475\u2019).  \n \nSampled drill cuttings were examined wet and dry under a binocular microscope using both plain \n(broad spectrum) and transmitted light. Cuttings were evaluated for hydrocarbon \u201ccut\u201d by \nimmersion in Acetone and inspection under a UV fluoroscope. 10% hydrochloric acid and \nalizarin red were used to determine the calcareous and dolomitic content of rocks and cementing. \n \nRPM Geologic, Inc. (RPM) well site geologists also closely examined MWD gamma-ray \ninformation and penetration rates to aid in steering decisions and dip degree estimations. \n \nVertical Operations \n \nOverview  \n \nThe Kline Federal 5300 41-18 10B was spud for surface drilling on 9 September 2014 utilizing \nNabors 486 as the drilling contractor. Prior to commencement of RPM mud logging services, a \n17 1/2\u201d hole was drilled with fresh water to depth of 2,125\u2019 and isolated with 13 3/8\u201d 54# J-55 \ncasing cemented from 2,083' to surface. To ensure hole stability a 12 \u00bc\u201d hole was drilled to a \ndepth of 6,140\u2019 and 40# 8 5/8 casing was set at 6,125\u2019. \n \nRPM well site geologists began logging the vertical interval at 8,350\u2019. \n \nTwo PDC bit were used to drill out of secondary casing casing to vertical TD. PDC bit #1 (8 \u00be\u201d \nVarel) was used to drill from 2,140\u2019 to 9,9500\u2019 and averaged an ROP of 62 ft/hr in 61.5 hours of \nuse.  A second Varel PDC bit was used to continue drilling to a vertical TD of 10,240\u2019 MD in 4.5 \nhours with an average penetration rate of 64.4 ft/hr"

The well was spud \nby Nabors 486 and the vertical hole was drilled to a total depth (KOP) of 10,240\u2019. \n \n2) A mud program consisted of diesel invert (9.8-9.9 ppg) after surface casing through the \ncurve build sections. The drilling mud was successful in maintaining stable hole \nconditions and minimizing washout through the salt intervals. Brine water with a weight \nof 9.6-9.7 ppg was used during lateral drilling operations to maintain hydrostatic balance \nuntil a TD of 20,475\u2019. \n \n3) Two 8 \u00be\u201d Varel PDC bit was used to drill out of surface casing to a KOP of 10,240\u2019. \nTwo 8 \u00be\u201d PDC bits were used to drill the curve to 11,175\u2019 MD. Four 6\u201d PDC bits were \nused to drill the lateral to 20,475\u2019 TD.  \n \n4) The lateral was targeting the Middle Member of the Bakken Formation member \nranging from about 9\u2019 and 19\u2019 below the base of the Upper Bakken Shale  \n \n \n5) Gas levels between 3000 and 4000 units were maintained with peaks over 8000 units \nthrough the lateral drilling operations while in the Middle Member.  \n \n6) The Middle Member of the Bakken Formation target consisted of one observed gross \nlithology. The Middle Member was observed to be a silty sandstone with lots of \ndisseminated pyrite and apparent intergranular porosity with visible oil stain. \n \n7) Trace to moderate oil stain was observed in zone associated with a fast, white, diffuse \ncut. Trace oil washed out of the samples into the wash water when they were cleaned. \n \n8) Drilling operations were concluded at 14:00 on July 8th, 2014 at a bottom hole location of \n254.45' south & 9968.39' east of surface location or approximately 754.45' FSL & \n283.76' FEL of SE SE Sec. 22, T153N-R100W. \n \n9) Oasis Petroleum\u2019s Kline Federal 5300 41-18 10B awaits completion operations to \ndetermine its ultimate production potential. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnnika Tostengard \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRPM Geologic LLC"

The \napproval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than \nthe 500' setback from the north & south boundaries and 200' setback from the east & west boundaries within the \n1280 acre spacing unit consisting of Sections 18 & 17 T153N R100W.  \n \nPERMIT STIPULATIONS: Due to the proximity of Lake Sakakawea to the well site, a dike is required \nsurrounding the entire location.  Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for \nfilter sock disposal must be maintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, and must \nremain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations are \nconducted. OASIS PETRO NO AMER must contact NDIC Field Inspector Richard Dunn at 701-770-\n3554 prior to location construction.   \n \nDrilling pit \nNDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that \u201ca pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well \ndrilling and completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will \nprevent pollution of the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits \nare prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized representative of the director prior to lining and use.  \nDrill cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings \npit.\u201d \n \nForm 1 Changes & Hard Lines  \n  Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.  \nThe proposed directional plan is at a legal location. Based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum \nlegal coordinate from the well head is: 10052\u2019 east. \n \nLocation Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period) \n   Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the \napproved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report.   If circumstances require operations to \ncommence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may \nbe waived by the Director.  Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information \nnecessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other \ninformation that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the \ndrilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit."

Surveys \nmust be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director may \nrequire the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the \noperation of the director's office in a timely manner.  Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe \ndocument, with a certification cover page to certsurvey@nd.gov.    \nSurvey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.  \nSpecifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve \n(or when sliding) and 90 feet in the lateral. \n \nSurface casing cement \n \nTail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12 \nhours, and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi \nbefore drilling the plug or initiating tests.   \n \nLogs \n \nNDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of (1) a suite of open hole logs from which formation tops and \nporosity zones can be determined, (2) a Gamma Ray Log run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore, and \n(3) a log from which the presence and quality of cement can be determined (Standard CBL or Ultrasonic cement evaluation \nlog) in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set, this log must be run prior to completing the well.  \nAll logs run must be submitted free of charge, as one digital TIFF (tagged image file format) copy and one digital LAS (log \nASCII) formatted copy.

The Commission is very \nconcerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry. \n \nEffective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the \nwell is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations \nare conducted.  The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an \nauthorized facility.  Such containers must be: \n\uf0b7 \nleakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container \n\uf0b7 \ncovered to prevent precipitation from entering the container \n\uf0b7 \nplacard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container \n \nIf the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but \nonly upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request. \n \nAs previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01 \nstates in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production \nwastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste \nManagement.  Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the \nsolid waste program.  Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud, \ninvert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.  \n \nThank you for your cooperation.  \n \n \n \nSincerely, \n \n \n \nBruce E. Hicks \n \n \nAssistant Director"
