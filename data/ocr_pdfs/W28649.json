Nabors B22 drilling the Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC - Chalmers 5300 21-19 11B \nduring January and February, 2015 in Baker Field, McKenzie County, North Dakota. \n(G. Wayne Peterson, Sunburst Consulting) \n \nINTRODUCTION  \n \nThe Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC Chalmers 5300 21-19 11B [Lot 2 Section 19, \nT153N, R100W] is located approximately 7 miles south of the town of Williston in McKenzie \nCounty, North Dakota. The Chalmers 5300 21-19 11B is a horizontal Middle Bakken well within \nthe Williston Basin consisting of one 9,615' lateral drilled toward the east. The vertical hole was \nplanned to be drilled to approximately 10,230\u2019. The curve would be built at 12 degrees per 100\u2019 \nto land within the Middle Bakken. This well is a two section lateral which originates in the \nnorthwest quarter of section 19, then drilled east to the southeast quarter of section 20. \nDirectional drilling technologies and geo-steering techniques were used to land in the Middle \nBakken reservoir and maintain exposure to the ideal target rock."

    "text": "OFFSET WELLS  \nOffset well data used for depth correlation during curve operations are found in the \u2018Control \nData\u2019 section appended to this report. Offset well control was essential in curve operations, to \nsuccessfully land within the Middle Bakken. Formation thicknesses expressed by gamma ray \nsignatures in these wells were compared to gamma data collected during drilling operations in \norder to successfully land the curve. The target landing true vertical depth (TVD) was \nperiodically updated during drilling to ensure accurate landing of the curve.  \n \nGEOLOGY \n \nThe Charles Formation [Mississippian Madison Group] was logged 8,536' MD 8,535' TVD        \n(-6,459' SS). Samples in the lower portion of the Charles Formation consisted of a lime \nmudstone, which was light brown, light gray brown, light gray brown, off white in color. It was \nmicrocrystalline, friable, laminated, with an earthy texture. A trace of intercrystalline porosity \nwas observed as was occasional to rare spotty light brown oil stain. Occasionally noted was a \ndolo-mudstone, which was light brown, light gray, light gray brown in color. It was \nmicrocrystalline, friable-firm, laminated, with an earthy texture. Also noted was a trace of \nintercrystalline porosity, and occasional spotty light brown oil stain. Rarely noted was anhydrite, \nwhich was off white, cream in color. It was soft, microcrystalline, and massive with an earthy to \namorphous texture.

The Mission Canyon Formation consisted of a lime mudstone that was \ndescribed as light gray, light brown to brown, gray brown, trace dark gray in color. The lime \nmudstone was predominately friable to firm, with an earthy to rarely crystalline in texture. Some \nintervals contained a trace of black-brown algal material, a trace of fossil fragments, and traces \nof disseminated pyrite. Also present was an argillaceous lime mudstone that was described as \nlight gray, occasional medium gray, rare gray tan, rare off white, trace dark gray in color. The \nargillaceous lime mudstone was predominately firm to friable, crystalline to chalky texture. \nSome intervals contained a trace of disseminated pyrite.  Following connections or periods of \nnon-circulation, gas peaks of 35 to 191 units were noted, as were drilling gas shows of 40 to 109 \nunits. Rare intercrystalline porosity was noted as well as traces to occasional spotty light brown \noil stain was occasionally observed while logging the Mission Canyon Formation. \n \n                                           \n \nFigure 2.

Oil and gas shows at the shakers and in samples \nwere continuously monitored. In the closed mud system, hydrostatic conditions were maintained \nnear balance, this allowed for gas and fluid gains from the well to be evaluated. Gas on the \nChalmers 5300 21-19 11B varied according to stratigraphic position and penetration rates which \nmay have reflected increased porosity. During the vertical, connection gas peaks of 35 to 191 \nunits were noted, as were drilling gas shows of 31 to 109 units, against a 10-11.5 lb/gal diesel-\ninvert mud weight. Background concentrations in the lateral ranged from 470 to 2,200 units, \nagainst a 9.6-9.7 lb/gal saltwater gel drilling fluid. Connection peaks of 2,000 to 3,000 units were \nobserved, as were drilling gas shows of 2,500 units to 5,490 units coinciding with the best shows. \nDrilling out of casing at 11,085 MD\u2019 yielded a trip gas of 984 units. The lateral was completed \nwith one bottom hole assembly, consequently no other trip gasses were noted.

It was first drilled with a bottom hole assembly (BHA) \nconsisting of bit #3, a Ulterra U516M PDC bit, attached to a 2.38 degree fixed NOV 7/8 5.0 \nmotor and MWD tools. Poor build rates caused this BHA to be replaced with bit # 4, a Smith \nF30T Tri-cone bit attached to a 2.60 degree Cavare 6/7 5.0 motor. Excessive build rates caused \nthis assembly to be replaced. The previously run Cavare motor was adjusted to 2.45 degrees and \nattached to bit #5, a Security MMD55M PDC bit. The curve was successfully landed at 11,085\u2019 \nMD and 10,767\u2019 TVD, approximately 23\u2019 into the Middle Bakken.

Offset well target definition, Indian Hills Prospect (Oasis).   \n \nSteering decisions were made by using gamma markers identified by Oasis representatives. The \nhigh gamma (C) in the upper portion of the drilling zone was useful in identifying the well-bore \nplacement in formation. The slightly lower gamma (B) was observed as the well-bore moved to \nthe top of the target zone, followed by lower gamma as the well-bore moved higher, out of the \ntarget zone. Low gamma in the middle of the target zone (D) was noted as the well-bore moved \nto the middle of the target zone. As the well-bore moved lower in formation, the higher gamma \n(E) was noted. Samples collected when drilling below the target zone tended to have a greater \nconcentration of the light gray to gray silty sandstone than did the samples collected when the \nwell-bore was higher in the target zone. The TD of 20,680\u2019 MD was achieved at 14:30 hours \nCST February 8, 2015.

The project was drilled from surface casing to TD \nin 16 days. The TD of 20,860\u2019 MD was achieved at 14:30 hours CST February 8, 2015. The well \nsite team worked together to maintain the well-bore in the desired target interval for 90% of the \nlateral, opening 9,615\u2019 of potentially productive reservoir rock. During the drilling of the lateral \nto avoid unnecessary doglegs it was decided not to steer the well-bore into the target zone for the \nsole purpose of regaining the target zone.  \n \nSamples in the Middle Bakken were predominantly silty sandstone which was described as light-\nmedium brown, occasional light gray brown, rare light gray in color. It was very fine grained, \nfirm-friable, sub rounded to sub angular, smooth, moderately sorted, calcite cement moderately \ncemented. A trace of disseminated and nodular pyrite was noted as was occasional intergranular \nporosity. Also noted was common light to medium brown spotty to even oil stain.  \n \nGas on the Chalmers 5300 21-19 11B varied according to stratigraphic position and penetration \nrates which may have reflected increased porosity. The overall gas and hydrocarbon shows were \nencouraging and indicate a hydrocarbon rich system in the Middle Bakken. \n \nThe Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC.

OASIS PETRO NO AMER must contact NDIC Field Inspector Richard Dunn at 701-\n770-3554 prior to location construction.   \n \nDrilling pit \nNDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that \u201ca pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well \ndrilling and completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will \nprevent pollution of the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits \nare prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized representative of the director prior to lining and use.  \nDrill cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings \npit.\u201d \n \nForm 1 Changes & Hard Lines  \n  Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.  \nThe proposed directional plan is at a legal location.  Based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum \nlegal coordinate from the well head is: 9963\u2019 east. \n \nLocation Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period) \n   Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the \napproved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report.   If circumstances require operations to \ncommence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may \nbe waived by the Director.  Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information \nnecessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other \ninformation that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the \ndrilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit."

Surveys \nmust be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director may \nrequire the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the \noperation of the director's office in a timely manner.  Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe \ndocument, with a certification cover page to certsurvey@nd.gov.    \nSurvey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.  \nSpecifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve \n(or when sliding) and 90 feet in the lateral. \n \nSurface casing cement \n \nTail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12 \nhours, and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi \nbefore drilling the plug or initiating tests.   \n \nLogs \n \nNDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of (1) a suite of open hole logs from which formation tops and \nporosity zones can be determined, (2) a Gamma Ray Log run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore, and \n(3) a log from which the presence and quality of cement can be determined (Standard CBL or Ultrasonic cement evaluation \nlog) in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set, this log must be run prior to completing the well.  \nAll logs run must be submitted free of charge, as one digital TIFF (tagged image file format) copy and one digital LAS (log \nASCII) formatted copy. Digital logs may be submitted on a standard CD, DVD, or attached to an email sent to \ndigitallogs@nd.gov \n   \nThank you for your cooperation.  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nSincerely,  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nNathaniel Erbele  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nPetroleum Resource Specialist"
