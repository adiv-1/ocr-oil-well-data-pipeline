Xtreme 21 drilling the Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC, Kline Federal 5300 11-18 3T well \nduring May of 2015 in Williams County, North Dakota. \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThe Oasis Petroleum, North America LLC, Kline Federal 5300 11-18 3T well is located \napproximately 4 miles south of Williston in McKenzie County, North Dakota [Lot 1 Section \n18, T153N, R100W].  The Kline Federal 5300 11-18 3T is a horizontal first bench, Three Forks \nwell within the Williston Basin consisting of one 9,739\u2019 lateral drilled toward the east. The \nwells surface, vertical and curve sections were previously drilled, and this evaluation will \nconsist of primarily operations and observations made during the lateral section. \n \nENGINEERING \n \nThe Kline Federal 5300 11-18 3T surface, vertical and curve sections were completed earlier \nin 2015 by a separate drilling rig. Extreme 21 returned to location in May of 2015 to drill the \nlaterals of the Kline Federal 5300 11-18 3T, 3T, 2B (Figure 1).  The Kline Federal 5300 11-\n18 3T was re-entered on May 22, 2015.  To start the lateral, a 6\u2033 Smith PDC bit, Ryan \nDirectional Services MWD tool, and a 1.5\u00b0 adjustable Ryan Directional Services mud motor \nbegan drilling operations. The complete bottom-hole assembly summary is tabulated as an \nappendix (BHA Record) to this report.  The well reached total depth at 20,840' MD at 12:45 \nCDT on May 28, 2015, generating an exposure of 9,739\u2019 linear feet of 6\u2033 hole through the \nThree Forks target interval.  The bottom-hole location (BHL) lies 875.04' south & 9,941.16' \neast of surface location or approximately 1,895.04' FNL & 314.95' FEL, SE NE Section 17, \nT153N, R100W."

    "text": "GEOLOGY \n \nLithology \n \nSunburst Geology, Inc. was not present for the vertical and curve holes therefore there is no \ninformation for formations and members prior to intermediate casing point. \n \nThree Forks Formation \n \nWhile the curve was being drilled the top of the Three Forks Formation was penetrated at \n10,940\u2019 MD, 10,775\u2019 TVD (-8,706\u2019).  The Kline Federal 5300 11-18 3T only targeted the \nupper Three Forks, 1st bench. This bench consisted of two main lithology types; most \ncommonly observed was a dolomite mudstone with lesser amounts of shale (Figure 2).  The \ntargeted dolomite was most commonly associated with cool gamma markers ranging from 90-\n50 API counts.  The mudstone was light brown to off white in color and was primarily firm to \nfriable but on occasions hard. The mudstone often displayed trace, very fine intercrystalline \nporosity, trace to rare light brown spotty oil staining, and trace amounts of disseminated pyrite \nand trace to rare amounts of nodular pyrite. Less commonly observed in samples was a light \ngreen to light blue-green shale, associated with 110-150 API count gamma signatures.  This \nshale was firm (occasionally soft) with an earthy texture, displayed a sub-blocky texture and \ncontained trace amounts of both disseminated and nodular pyrite, more than that seen \nthroughout the dolomite intervals. Throughout the lateral, samples observed in the upper \nportion of the target interval displayed more shale than those seen at the base.  At the very base \nof the target zone was a claystone interval. This claystone is what separates the first and second \nbenches of the Three Forks Formation.  \n \n \nFigure 2. Dolomite and trace amounts of shale observed throughout the target interval."

    "text": "Geosteering \n \nThe potential pay zone was identified by evaluating gamma data collected while drilling the \nOasis Petroleum, Kline Federal 5300 41-18 11T2.  The target was determined to be 10\u2019 thick, \nlie 15\u2019 below the Pronghorn Member and have the base bounded by a 12\u2019 claystone interval.  \nThe target zone had a reliable, higher gamma marker at the very top of target, cooler markers \nthroughout the middle of section, and higher gamma counts at the base representing the \nclaystone (Figure 3).  \n \n \nFigure 3. Gamma characteristics observed throughout the Three Forks, first bench while drilling the Oasis \nPetroleum, Kline Federal 5300 41-18 11T2. \n \nStructure maps provided by Oasis Petroleum indicated that for the first several thousand feet \ndip rates would trend downward before flattening near the halfway point and turning up at the \ntoe of the lateral. Upon drilling out of intermediate casing, the plan was to maintain an \ninclination so the top of the claystone could be confirmed, and be used throughout the rest of \nthe lateral if stratigraphic location was ever in question.  As anticipated, structure dipped \ndownward for the first several thousand feet before leveling and turning up around 15,500\u2019 \nMD.  Shortly after the dip reversal, formation began to dip downwards again for approximately \n1,000\u2019, to a depth of ~17,600\u2019 MD.  Finally, as structure maps indicated, the formation leveled \nand began to dip favorably upward through total depth (Figure 4)."

    "text": "Hydrocarbon Shows  \n \nOil and gas shows at the beginning of the lateral were relatively low, but as well-bore exposure \nincreased, from ~13,900\u2019 to 20,840\u2019 MD, were very promising.  Gas values rose gradually, \nwith values exceeding 1,500 units toward the middle and end of the lateral section (Figure 4). \nThe most promising oil staining observed in samples was observed in the upper half of the \ntarget. Consistently, throughout the lateral, this interval displayed trace amounts of spotty to \noccasionally even, light to medium brown oil staining.  This upper portion also displayed the \nmore favorable fluorescent cuts. Cuts observed in the upper portion of the target zone reacted \nmoderately fast, and streamed pale yellow to light green.  The lower half of the target did not \ndisplay as encouraging hydrocarbon shows as the upper half, but were still favorable. The \nlower half displayed almost 100% dolomite that displayed trace light brown spotty oil staining. \nThe least promising gas and oil shows were observed when making contact with the claystone, \nwith gas shows rarely exceeded 400 units. Samples throughout the claystone also displayed \nlittle, and often no, oil staining.  Over the course of the lateral there was no oil observed at the \nshakers and there was never a need vent or circulate fluid through the gas buster. \n \n \n \nFigure 4. Cross-sectional interpretation of the Kline Federal 5300 11-18 3T borehole with estimated dip based \non lithology, MWD data, drill rate, and regional structural data."

    "text": "SUMMARY \n \nThe Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC, Kline Federal 5300 11-18 3T lateral hole was \ndrilled by Xtreme 21, from re-entry to total depth in 7 days. The well reached a total depth of \n20,840' MD on May 28, 2015. Geologic data, hydrocarbon gas measurements, and sample \nexamination indicate an encouraging hydrocarbon bearing system in the Three Forks.  Positive \nbackground, connection and survey gas shows were recorded throughout the lateral. Samples \nconsisted of cream to light gray dolomite with very fine intercrystalline porosity and trace light \nbrown oil staining, interbedded with blue-green shale.  Samples yielded faint, light green, \nmoderate, diffuse to streaming cut fluorescence.  The well was within the target zone for 84% \nof the lateral, successful in exposing 9,739' of potentially productive first bench, Three Forks.  \nThe well currently awaits completion operations.  \n \n  \nRespectfully submitted, \n \nDillon Johnson \n \nWell-site Geologist \n \nSunburst Consulting, Inc. \n \nMay 28, 2015"

A few key points: \n1) We will move the rig to the Carson SWD pad once we have finished drilling the vertical portions of all 3 wells on \nthis pad. \n2) \nWe will finish drilling the vertical portion of the third well, the Kline Federal S300 11-18 2B, on April 9th. \n3) We will utilize a 2nd rig to drill the lateral portions of the 3 wells on this pad. \n4) The 2nd rig is currently drilling wells on a different pad and is scheduled to reach TD on the final well in late \nMay/early June, leaving a gap of approximately SS days. \n5) We will be able to return to the Kline Federal S300 11-18 pad on or before June 6th. \nGiven the time sensitive nature of this request, expedited review of these sundries would be greatly appreciated. \nThank you for your consideration, \nMichael P.

The Commission is very \nconcerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry. \n \nEffective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the \nwell is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations \nare conducted.  The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an \nauthorized facility.  Such containers must be: \n\uf0b7 \nleakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container \n\uf0b7 \ncovered to prevent precipitation from entering the container \n\uf0b7 \nplacard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container \n \nIf the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but \nonly upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request. \n \nAs previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01 \nstates in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production \nwastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste \nManagement.  Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the \nsolid waste program.  Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud, \ninvert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.  \n \nThank you for your cooperation.  \n \n \n \nSincerely, \n \n \n \nBruce E. Hicks \n \n \nAssistant Director"
